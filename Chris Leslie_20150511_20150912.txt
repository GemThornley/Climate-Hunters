i beg to move an amendment  at the end of the question to add “but regret that the gracious speech fails to provide a strategy to build the productive economy that the country needs  note that a fragile recovery and stagnating productivity harms living standards and makes it harder to reduce the deficit  believe that every effort should now be concentrated on supporting middle  and lower income working people  further note that the gracious speech is a missed opportunity to tackle the principal causes of rising welfare costs that flow from a low wage  high rent economy  further believe in the pooling and sharing of resources across the uk as the best mechanism for delivering social and economic change  urge the government to pursue sensible savings in public expenditure as part of a balanced approach and not an ideologically driven attempt to shrink public services beyond what is needed to address the deficit  and call upon ministers to spell out where their cuts will fall and who will pay for their unfunded election pledges ”i welcome the chancellor to his place  very few people serve two full terms as chancellor and i am sure that the whole country will be grateful that he does not plan to do so either  although he might have his eye on another job  i congratulate him on his reappointment to this one  of course  we should not ignore the fact that he has a fancy new title to illustrate his role in the eu renegotiation process  he is now the first secretary of state  no less  following in the footsteps of john prescott and peter mandelson  let us hope that his ministerial counterparts are suitably impressed the chancellor must now deliver negotiations with other member states to convince the public to opt decisively for britain to remain a member of the europeanunion  it is important to secure stronger rules so that welfare payments go only to those who have contributed to our system  but in my view we also need greater devolution from brussels  an overhaul of the eu budget and far greater accountability of the main institutions of the european union  which still feel too distant and out of touch  it is also essential that he agrees that we need a comprehensive independent risk analysis of britain leaving the european union  it needs to be carried out by the bank of england  the treasury and the office for budget responsibility and it needs to be published in ample time for the public to consider it in full before the referendum although this is not the queen’s speech that i wanted the house to be debating  i reassure everybody and remind the chancellor that we will be a vigilant and responsible opposition  watching closely the choices he still has to make and holding him to account at every step 
i have had plenty of time to reflect on the result of the general election  obviously  we are disappointed with it and we will review our policies accordingly  but it is now our job to ask questions and scrutinise what the hon  gentleman and those on his front bench plan to do  i shall come shortly to my observations about that let us not neglect the subject at hand  which is the queen’s speech  the headlines have  of course  now been spun and the rhetoric from ministers has started  they are trying in vain to make all the right noises about fairness and even a one nation government  but let us pause for a moment  walk through the measures in the queen’s speech and cut through the spin the tax free minimum wage for those working 30 hours sounds fine until we realise that it is already tax free  the real question is why there is no action in the queen’s speech for the low paid  such as incentives for a living wage  which even the mayor of london supports  i do not know whether he is in his place  but perhaps he will join us later as for the rest of the spin  the household benefit cap  although it is necessary  is only a drop in the ocean of the overall welfare bill  saving less than one 10th of 1   and is a total distraction from the root cause of escalating welfare costs for the taxpayer in recent years  the low wage nature of our economy what about devolution to a northern powerhouse  if it is genuine  that is all well and good  but local communities have heard these promises before and they know that when the chancellor talks about devolution it is usually code for shifting the consequence of cuts and not the power to deliver services 
the clue was at the beginning of the hon  gentleman’s intervention  labour leaders do work well together in local government  and when we hear the chancellor’s response to this debate they might find that there are a few surprises and a hidden agenda with a bit of a sting in the tail for them over the next few months what about the rest of the spin in the queen’s speech  such as extending the right to buy  everyone is in favour of home ownership  of course  but the scheme proposed by ministers is so badly thought through  throwing housing associations into chaos  that even the mayor of london   for it is he   has called it the “height of insanity” there was a further piece of spin  of course  a tax lock designed purely to stop the chancellor raising vat again  do not get me wrong  we welcome any effort by the chancellor to legislate against his own record and his own worst instincts  but this legislation does nothing more than prove that he does not even trust himself on tax  of course  it does not give any guarantees about other stealth tax rises elsewhere  nor does it prevent him from acting on his other instinct of always prioritising tax cuts for the very richest over those for those on middle and low incomes     interruption   conservative members are all shouting from the back benches  but the chancellor’s eyes are down on his notes  is the chancellor planning to cut that top rate of tax from 45p on earnings of more than £150 000  i will give way to the chancellor if he can clarify for us whether that is his plan  will he cut that rate of 45p for those earning £150 000  or not 
perhaps the hon  gentleman knows the answer 
we have heard those arguments  i was asking the government whether they plan to cut the top rate of tax of earnings of £150 000 from 45p  and perhaps down to 40p  and there is silence from the government benches and from the chancellor  perhaps he will come to that later in his speech the queen’s speech was high on rhetoric but was in reality the usual combination of diversion and distraction  as ever with this chancellor  there is more than meets the eye  all the rhetoric is just the tip of a tory iceberg  with 90  of their real agenda hidden below the surface  still invisible from public view  that agenda will not even be partly revealed until the emergency budget on 8 july  until then  serious questions remain unanswered about what drives the government  and in what direction the trajectory of overall cuts set out in the march budget goes beyond what is needed to eradicate the deficit by the end of the parliament  according to the institute for fiscal studies  the queen’s speech still leaves us totally in the dark about more than 85  of the chancellor’s planned £12 billion of welfare cuts  just this morning  the ifs criticised the government for giving a“misleading impression of what departmental spending in many areas will look like” frankly  there is growing disbelief across the country that the chancellor can protect those in greatest need while keeping his promises to the electorate on child benefit and disability benefits  my hon  friends will not have failed to spot during prime minister’s question time yesterday how the prime minister  when challenged by my right hon  friend the member for east ham  stephen timms  on the question of disability benefits  digressed into all sorts of reminiscences about the campaign trail and how much fun it was going to various meetings  the prime minister promised that“the most disabled should always be protected”and i will be looking to the chancellor and the secretary of state for work and pensions to keep the prime minister’s promises  the government might have secured a majority  but they did not secure a mandate for specific cuts to departments or services because those were never explained or set out before the election  nor have we ever had an explanation of how they will pay for their multi billion pound pledges on tax and services or  crucially  for the nhs the opposition agree with yesterday’s oecd assessment that a fair approach is the right one to take   sensible savings and protection for those on middle and lower incomes  cuts that decimate public services would be too big a price to pay  especially as they may even result in higher costs in the longer term  we also heard how 8 000 nurse training places were cut in 2010  the use of agency nurses then proliferated to fill the gap  is it any wonder  therefore  that nhs trusts now face a deficit of about £2 billion  part of the reason the deficit is so big is that productivity has been so poor  britain has the second lowest productivity in the g7  and output per worker is still lower than in 2010  this should have been at the top of the chancellor’s agenda throughout the last parliament  but he did not even mention it in his last budget speech  for the tories  it seems that productivity just springs magically if the government just get out of the way  unrelated to any fiscal or policy choices that they make 
i will come to that in a moment  the hon  gentleman must also be staggered that the chancellor did not even mention it in his budget speech  that was an omission that the chancellor needs to correct  we take a different view of where productivity comes from because  for us  it depends in part on having decent infrastructure and public services   motorways that flowfreely and trains that commuters can actually get on  tax offices answering business queries efficiently rather than keeping companies’ staff waiting on hold  employees who are off sick able to get treated swiftly in a decent nhs  an education system that supports a work force and provides training in high quality skills  each of these is crucial for our future economic productivity  and each depends on the chancellor making the right fiscal choices for this parliament 
my hon  friend makes a good point  according to the obr  if productivity growth per worker was closer to 4   our national debt would be £350 billion lower by the end of this parliament  there is a connection between the choices that are made in fiscal policy and the productive nature of our economy the oecd confirmed just yesterday in a sobering reality check for the chancellor that continued weak productivity could lead to a higher than expected budget deficit  and he should listen to the oecd 
the civil service used to have a phrase for things like this  it was a brave decision of the right hon  gentleman to defend his government’s record on infrastructure  many projects that were started under the previous government have still not been completed  would it not be better if we rose above party political picking out of which infrastructure project should proceed and we tried to have a more mature debate about how we plan infrastructure in this country the chancellor knows that sir john armitt’s report on infrastructure was widely received across the business community and that all sorts of parties that wanted to find an independent approach to infrastructure planning  i still believe that that would be a better  more grown up way to plan for infrastructure 
of course individual choices have to be made  but it would be better if they were made on the basis of need and evidence  not simply on whether the hon  gentleman has the ear of a particular minister ata particular point in time  that is the old way to plan infrastructure  and he knows in his heart that we should reform it the choices that the chancellor makes in the emergency budget in july will be crucial for productivity and therefore crucial to the health of the economy and public finances  i want to know whether the chancellor will set out a sensible approach to deficit reduction by prioritising the areas of public spending that raise productivity  why do we not ask the obr to report on how the options for the spending review might impact on productivity and living standards and to set out the impact of the different choices that the chancellor could make  he will have our support if he wants it to do that work  as the oecd suggested yesterday  the uneven profile of his planned fiscal pathway poses real risks  and higher productivity would give greater scope to protect working families  while still balancing the books  so these are the choices that he must confront  is he still planning to double the pace of cuts  regardless of the impact on productivity  or is he now planning to moderate that pathway  the chancellor has wiggle room here  even within his own fiscal rules 
this is at the heart of the chancellor’s policy choices  is he looking not just at how much but how spending is taking place  he can choose to ensure that where spending has to be prioritised  decisions lean towards supporting growth and productivity and the skills that will in turn get us into that more virtuous cycle 
i will give way in a moment  not to take a reasonable and measured approach  when the chancellor clearly has scope to do so  would suggest that he is influenced much more by conservative ideology than by economic judgment  that is what it always comes down to with this chancellor  is he focusing on securing the long term needs of the economy or on securing his own long term future  is he focusing on the country or on his back benchers  is he focusing on his current job or on a future one 
of course competition is essential  but so are important public services that support businessesand enable them to optimise the outputs from the inputs to the production process  that is the crucial point that we have to focus on 
long term investment  especially production process technology and business investment  is crucial  which is why the stop start approach of recent years from the treasury has seen us underperform in business investment into the productive economy  it is essential 
i know that the hon  gentleman wants to make his political points  but i think we have a duty to ensure that we examine far more forensically the drivers of economic productivity and the growth that will help us to repair the public finances more successfully  that is the agenda we have to follow these are serious times  and we needed a serious queen’s speech agenda to address britain’s long term economic challenges  we should not forget that progress in our economy is still fragile and the recovery is still too constrained  the economy remains fraught with pressures  which have been heaped on the shoulders of many working people  for example  the number of people who have to work a second job in order to get by has increased dramatically in recent years  and a record number of pensioners are returning to the labour market  indeed  the number of over 65s in employment has increased by more than 8  over the past year alone  the office for national statistics says that our share of high skilled jobs is falling  the government’s vision for britain is one of a low wage  bargain basement economy  that is not the vision of a party for working people 
i do not know whether the hon  gentleman has seen the ons report published yesterday  but it shows that we are losing high skilled employment in this country and that gradually it is being replaced with low skilled employment  which is a real worry  we need to ensure that we compete in the world on the basis of a high skilled  virtuous cycle  i think that he would be complacent if he ignored what is happening in our economy 
i cannot remember whether i have given way to the hon  gentleman already but  given that he is being so polite and persistent  i will give way one last time to him 
when it comes to deficit reduction  let us never forget that the chancellor of the exchequer promised to eradicate the deficit by the end of the previous parliament  we have passed that deadline  so he has broken that promise  he should put his hands up and admit that  when it came to his promise on the deficit  he failed we now need focus to address our economic challenges  not a chancellor distracted by his own political ambition  we need a concerted drive to boost productivity  a balanced recovery reaching all corners of the country  with no sector left behind  a meaningful effort to tackle the root causes of higher welfare costs  low pay and insecure working conditions  a guarantee that any scope for tax cuts should be focused entirely on middle and lower earners  and a commitment to reject an ideological drive to shrink public investment  that is the approach britain needs  that would be a genuinely one nation approach instead  we had a queen’s speech that focused on short term political headlines  rather than long term economic gain  it was designed to lay political traps for the chancellor’s opponents as part of a grand political chess game  rather than to focus on productivity and balanced growth  this obsession with short term  narrow political gain is the chancellor’s curse  he is the chancellor for whom productivity means kicking the home secretary off her cabinet committees  he is the chancellor for whom a long term plan means a move next door  he is sticking with the family business and measuring up the wallpaper for no  10 already  that is his real agenda  cold and calculating  he is the iceberg chancellor  with hidden dangers beneath the surface  he is putting productivity and public services are risk  prioritising the very richest above those on middle and lower incomes  pitting one nation against another  britain did not vote for a hidden agenda  i urge the chancellor to put the ambitions of britain above his own 
 rose   
very funny  i asked the chancellor about an issue of substance   whether he is planning to cut the 45p rate of tax on earnings of £150 000  is he able to rule that out as unfair and inappropriate 
i warned in my earlier remarks about the chancellor’s hidden agenda  before he went into the section on royal mail  i think i heard him announce upwards of £4 5 billion or more of in year cuts to public services    hon  members  “savings ”  i think he called it “good housekeeping”  he announced in year savings of that magnitude without coming to the house to give an oral statement or publishing them for the house  so that we can scrutinise what he has just announced  it sounds to me as though any semblance of a long term plan has been totally ripped up  and that there is panic in the treasury and chaos  with in year public spending decisions being taken  why did he not announce those in the march budget if they were part of some sort of long term continuum  has he suddenly decided rapidly to change his course when it comes to public expenditure  and why do it in such a shabby way 
 rose   
on a point of order  mr speaker  it is the usual convention  if there are significant changes to the estimates and supply that support public services  that the documentation and details for every single department should be laid before the house of commons  so that all members can be informed of what is happening with our public services within a financial year  this is ripping up any semblance of long term continuity  and it is a shabby way to treat parliament and the public services 
 rose   
i welcome the new minister to her role  but where is the chancellor of the exchequer  should he not have the courtesy to come to house of commons and answer questions on what might be one the most important financial decisions of this parliament  taxpayers deserve to know more about what is going on here  why is it that when there are difficult questions  the chancellor always blames someone else or sends someone else taxpayers who bailed out rbs during the global financial crisis want their money back and will rightly be suspicious of any rush to sell  when rbs is still restructuring the business and awaiting a us settlement for the mis selling of subprime mortgages  would a premature sale not pose a risk for the taxpayer  the chancellor said two years ago that he would countenance a sale of rbs only when“the bank is fully able to support our economy and when we get good value” does the minister really think that those tests have now been met although we have always supported the eventual return of rbs to the private sector  is it not essential that the treasury get back as much money as possible to help pay down the national debt  why the rush when the share price is so far below the break even point  rbs had to be bailed out urgently  but it does not have to be sold off at the same speed  the minister should not give the impression  either  that the governor of the bank of england is telling ministers that the price is now right  because he makes it very clear in his letter that questions of valuation are entirely for the government before government members start pretending that the rbs rescue was somehow not a matter of consensus at the time  we are not going to let them re write history  the truth is that the chancellor did not oppose the urgent rescue of rbs at the market price back in 2008  the national audit office says that the rescue price was “justified” and the institute for fiscal studies says it was“not obviously unfavourable to taxpayers” they know full well what the consequences would have been if the bank had gone under on the specifics  will the minister clarify for the record exactly what the government accept the break even share price for the bank to be  the figure of a potential £7 2 billion loss might be understating things  because the rothschild calculation she mentioned nets off the fees the government have received from the bank since 2008 on lloyds  the treasury has already pledged that shares sold through the government’s trading plan will not be sold for less than 73 6p   the price the government paid for them  what is the equivalent red line below which the treasury would not sell an rbs share  why can the minister not give us more detail about precisely when the sale will commence and what impact she predicts it will have on debt reduction as for the extremely dodgy claim that if we roll everything together  stand on one leg and squint a bit  losses at rbs do not really look that bad after all  is not that a bit like saying  “i’ve sold the house and lost a fortune  but don’t worry because i got a great deal on the car”  come off it  the government cannot pretend they are not making a loss on rbs just because they are making a gain on completely separate assets elsewhere  at a time when the chancellor is reportedly on the brink of axing £5 billion from tax credits for children of working parents  should not the government be far more careful not to lose billions more by rushing a sale on rbs  everyone knows that when it comes to getting value for money  they have poor form  just look at the fire sale of royal mail we have to ask what the real reasons for this hasty sell off are  we saw in the march budget that the chancellor rushed forward asset sales in order to just about meet the treasury’s debt target  is he repeating the same thing before the emergency budget  regardless of the best price for the taxpayer  or perhaps this is the chancellor trying to prove his ideological credentials as part of his leadership bid  to impress all those new conservative back benchers  taxpayers need to know that there are sound reasons for this and that he is not doing it just to suit himself  we have a hidden chancellorand a hidden agenda  it is now for the government to justify the claim that they are putting taxpayers’ interests first 
tomorrow the house of commons will debate productivity  probably the central challenge facing our economic recovery  will the chancellor of the exchequer be leading for the government in response to that debate 
the chancellor clearly feels that productivity is not a priority of his  i am surprised that he will not be responding on this central question  after all  he will be here  as he will be acting as prime minister in prime minister’s questions tomorrow  if i can bring him back to the economy and he could rein in his personal ambitions for a moment  will the chancellor set out where productivity features in his ambitions  while we have got the chancellor here today   he is obviously not bothered about the debate tomorrow   will he explain why he failed to mention productivity in his march budget speech just three months ago 
i beg to move that this house notes that uk economic productivity has been stagnating for several years with productivity growth the second worst of the g7 countries  recognises that supporting business to improve output efficiency and enhanced productivity is the best route to higher living standards and in turn is crucial for the health of the public finances  regrets that the chancellor failed to address productivity in his march budget speech  urges the government to ask the office for budget responsibility to report on the impact on productivity of the options likely to be considered in the forthcoming spending review  and believes that decisions on reducing public service expenditure must take into account their impact on productivity performance the productivity of our economy and of businesses  the workforce and the resources of our country is critical for our recovery and for our future prosperity  there should be a cross party consensus that productivity is the key challenge facing britain today  which is why i was very disappointed by the chancellor’s attitude at treasury questions yesterday and at his point blank refusal to engage with this crucial debate in the house of commons today  we have learned that when it comes to dealing with issues that he does not want to attend to  the chancellor either blames someone else or sends someone else  in that growing tradition  i welcome the new chief secretary to the treasury to his new role 
of course i will  how could i not 
i am sure the chancellor is very much focused on being the prime minister in waiting  he is  of course  the eminent first secretary of state  and i hope his junior ministers occasionally manage to peek round his door and get the odd minute of his very busy time on these matters the mark of a chancellor focused on our economic challenges would have been to engage a bit more thoughtfully in considering how best we can tackle britain’s productivity problems  but he could not bring himself to mention productivity once during his 8 000 word budget speech three months ago 
i am sorry that the hon  gentleman finds my remarks a little churlish  when did he last speak to the chancellor about productivity 
i am delighted to hear it  i only wish that the chancellor would come and talk to the rest of us about productivity 
thank you for that sage advice  madam deputy speaker  i suspect that the chancellor will be forced to address the question of productivity in the forthcoming emergency budget on 8 july  let us dwell for a moment on why productivity matters 
that is why i think it is so appalling that the chancellor could not be bothered to mention it in the budget speech in march  it should be at the top of the agenda of all treasury teams and all departments   
i will give way in a moment to the hon  gentleman  who will  i know  have plenty to contribute on the subject our economic prosperity depends on maximising the output from the efforts of working people and the resources available to business  the amount of output per hour worked is a useful way for us to measure whether our economy is advancing and adding value  or whether we are just treading water  creating a more productive economy means creating a virtuous circle of higher growth  higher living standards and  as a consequence  more effective deficit reduction  when working people can produce more and they have the tools and the skills to create output more efficiently  employers can afford to pay them more  tax revenues become more buoyant and our gdp can grow in a more sustainable way 
i will give way to my hon  friend after i have given way to the hon  member for wyre forest  mark garnier  
i will send the hon  gentleman the anthology of chris leslie’s speeches  because i am sure that he will be keen to find out every occasion   in 2013  2014 and 2015   on which i have talked about productivity  i have been talking about it for a very long time  we must not think of it as simply a parliamentary issue  the cbi has emphasised the importance of higher productivity as the only way to secure long term and sustainable wage growth  in the words of the governor of the bank of england “productivity growth   doing more with less   is the key determinant of income growth  our shared prosperity depends on it ”as paul krugman famously put it “productivity isn’t everything  but in the long run it is almost everything ”we need a cross party approach to the challenge 
we can see that the problem is particularly stark when we make those international comparisons  our productivity growth rate has plummeted to the second worst in the g7  the uk was ranked 29th out of 36 oecd countries for gdp growth between 2010 and 2014  my hon  friend makes an important point 
i give way to my hon  friend 
as my hon  friend says  it is incredibly important to invest in new production process technologies and make sure that we have the necessary machinery and capital equipment  i will turn to business investment and how we can incentivise it  we have to make sure that the chancellor addresses those challenges  he has his emergency budget and his own political priorities that he wants to put first  but this  ultimately  is the key 
the hon  member for north west leicestershire  andrew bridgen  was on his feet first  and i would not want to pick the right hon  gentleman before him 
labour members have consistently supported proper and sustained capital allowances for business investment  one of the errors in the previous parliament was that the chancellor reduced them so rapidly before he then saw the error of his ways and returned them to the level at which they are now  that chopping and changing  stop start approach is anathema to good  proper  long term business planning we would not know it from the chancellor’s complacency  but uk economic productivity is stuck in the slow lane  according to the office for national statistics  the stagnation of productivity growth is “unprecedented” in post war britain  earlier this month  the oecd said that weak labour productivity remains a problem and that“the sustainability of economic expansion and further progress in living standards rest on boosting productivity growth” the bank of england has emphasised the “extremely and uncharacteristically weak” growth in uk productivity and said that there is still“great uncertainty about how productivity might evolve”and how that could affect the economy 
the evidence is very clear that we have had persistently poor productivity in recent years  i will talk about the impact of government investment on infrastructure and tackling the skills challenge that we need to address  the issue has been very much kicked into the long grass in recent years  and that is not good enough 
it is important to recognise that productivity problems are not the same across every single sector  some sectors are managing to break through and making a difference  perhaps relative to other sectors in other parts of the world  it is important that we focus on apprenticeships and skills  but the quality of those apprenticeships is key as well  i will say more about skills  on which we have just had an opposition day debate 
i agree that we need far better scrutiny of the nature of apprenticeships and of skills and training  we sometimes have a blanket approach that all schemes or tax incentives are the same and   this is theclassic whitehall problem   leave them without going into the detail of how they add value and of how quality fits in  i would advocate a better look at the quality of such investments 
i ought to give way to the right hon  gentleman 
normally  i have a lot of respect for the right hon  gentleman  but i am afraid his facts on that are wrong  under the previous labour government  we had a period of sustained productivity growth    hon  members  “public sector ”  did i hear something  madam deputy speaker  when it comes to private sector productivity  we had a sustained period of growth  we can talk about public sector productivity  but i am focusing on the wider economic  private sector productivity  which is ultimately the way in which we create wealth and prosperity in this country i am very proud of what the previous labour government did  between 1997 and the period just before the global financial crisis  productivity grew by an average of 2 2   in fact  it reached 4 2  in 2003  at the time  the uk’s productivity was second only to that of the united states  the cbi has emphasised that improvements in labour productivity accounted for almost three quarters of uk economic growth during that decade  over that period  real wages rose faster in the uk than in other advanced economies  and rising productivity and gdp growth meant that the previous labour government were able to take significant steps in tackling poverty and improving public services  that was not by accident  but by design we achieved sustainable growth in productivity because of relentless efforts to focus on competition  innovation  investment  skills and enterprise  including a 10 year framework for science and innovation  incentives for investment in business research and development  the expansion of higher education and adult and vocational training  that was the record of the previous labour government 
there is indeed a problem in the shift away from the added value  higher skilled economy that we must have to maintain our place in  and indeed win  that famous global race  if we think that we can do it simply by chasing lower wage  lower skilled markets  we will never ultimately succeed relative to other countries 
i will make a little progress  if i may  and then give way the office for budget responsibility’s recent forecasts have lamented the persistent weakness of our recent productivity  according to the obr  if our productivity per worker was closer to 4   our national debt would be £350 billion lower by the end of this parliament  those are big numbers  but that is £5 000 less debt for each person in this country  the productivity issue is therefore absolutely crucial  and it is linked to the health of our public finances  translated into potential gdp  it would mean growth of 3 7  by 2019 20  which is the sort of growth that we need in this country  the obr is right to warn that improvements in growth and living standards very much depend on our productivity performance and to say that it is the most important and uncertain part of its economic forecasts quite simply  if sustainable productivity growth fails to materialise  the chancellor will just continue to miss his deficit reduction targets  however hard he may try to distract us with his dreams about permanent surpluses  although productivity traditionally drops off during a recession  seven years after the global banking crisis our productivity is still 1 7  below the pre crisis peak  and a whopping 16  below the level implied by the pre crisis trend  last year  productivity growth was just 0 2   in 2013  it was negative  at minus 0 3   and in 2012  minus 1 2   that is just not good enough 
this might be a shock to the hon  gentleman  and i am not sure where he was at the time  but there was a global banking crisis     interruption   i know it is a shock to conservative members  because in their script it has been expunged from the record  as if it never happened 
i think there is a case to be made for ensuring that we focus on the morale of those in employment  there is an optimal point from which morale can dip and fall  we have to focus on what creates the optimal circumstances for those in work to produce the amounts that our economy needs  that is all part of this complicated picture when we have managed to get the chancellor to talk about productivity in the past  he referred to a “productivity puzzle”  if we are looking for clues to the solution to that puzzle  looking more closely at the nature of our economic recovery is important  it still feels a bit stressed  quite fraught and fragile  reflecting on that is part of the solution on skills  just a few weeks ago  the office for national statistics published its analysis showing that the share of high skilled jobs in the economy is falling relative to the share of low skilled work  which is of course taking its place  the bank of england’s last inflation report stated that since mid 2013  employment growth had been more concentrated in lower skilled occupations  concluding that this shift in the composition of the labour force could have dragged down aggregate productivity growth over the past two years that is not something that we should simply accept  i do not believe that we are just at the mercy of events and unable to influence our economic productivity  on this side  we believe that it does not have to be that way  history shows that britain can do better  by contrast with the traditional conservative approach  which is to step back and hope that productivity magically springs from the market out of thin air  we take a very different view  we believe that decent infrastructure and decent public services can support business growth  motorways that flow freely and trains that commuters can get on  tax offices that answer business queries efficiently rather than keeping their company staff always on hold  swift treatment of sick employees in a decent nhs  all that is part of the productivity story  as is an education system that supports a workforce with high quality skills  so many aspects of our public services are crucial for our future economic productivity  each of those depends on the chancellor making the right fiscal choices for this parliament  this should have been at the top of the chancellor’s agenda throughout the last parliament  for him not even to mention it in the last budget speech was a grievous error 
as i said earlier  different sectors face different productivity challenges  ultimately  if we think that this is just a problem in one or two sectors  we would be wrong  we need to address this forensically and make sure that we look from sector to sector to assess the problem in a mature  evidence led way  that is what we need to do i am aware that many members want to join the debate because they believe that productivity is an important topic  i respect them for that  but it is important not to let this issue pass without seeing the connection between productivity and the health of our public finances  we still have a £75 billion deficit in this country and i would like the new chief secretary to at least acknowledge in his response to the debate the truth that stronger productivity is crucial for repairing the public finances we need sensible savings across non protected departments to reduce levels of public expenditure  but if the chancellor makes the wrong fiscal choices in the forthcoming emergency budget he could make the situation far worse  there is a hard headed business case for protecting and prioritising those services that enhance investment  skills and innovation  that is the responsible fiscal approach the chancellor should take  productivityshould not be adversely affected by his fiscal choices and that is the point that i hope the chancellor will understand  whether he does and whether he can see through his political ambitions to the economic consequence of the decisions he takes are the important issues i have written to robert chote  the director of the office for budget responsibility  to see whether we can make some progress  working across parties  to try to get a better evidence led approach to the impact of the choices the chancellor faces on productivity and on levels of public investment  i think that an obr review would acknowledge the centrality of the productivity challenge and would help to make the right choices for the country  it would be better to have that evidence led understanding of the consequences of alternative fiscal choices 
as one industry declines  others will have to fill the gap  it is also important to recognise that multiple aspects of energy activity and energy markets are coming on stream and we need to ensure that we develop them and exploit new opportunities for our country  for energy security and for our future economic prosperity 
that is a crucial point  a far healthier environment is one in which the workforce feel valued and that they have a stake in the output  not just in their wages but as partners in the company or in the firm  those are the sorts of discussions we must have about the economy we want for the long term the chancellor faces a fork in the road  and this is very relevant as the emergency budget on 8 july approaches  will he take an ideological approach to public services and public investment or will he join a consensus that productivity  growth and living standards should be at the heart of those budget choices  we are now hearing some practical options that are open to the chancellor if he is serious about boosting productivity we need further reform of incentives to encourage research and development  support scientific discovery and underpin long term financial backing for projects that do not necessarily always yield near term returns  we need to break the politicking about infrastructure and flush through the pipeline of stalled projects  ministersshould feel free to steal the idea of a more independent and evidence led approach to infrastructure prioritisation as advocated so eloquently by sir john armitt in his report for us before the election  we need to sweat the authorisations already voted for by parliament to underwrite infrastructure development with government backed guarantees  which are so woefully underutilised at present  we need skills and training to flourish and not fall victim to short term and ill thought through budget decisions driven by a political timetable  we need serious action on housing supply to help working people with the choices they face in work and to support new employment opportunities as they arise  and we need clarity that local enterprise partnerships will get the immediate devolved powers required to unlock local growth   not political delays because the chancellor takes exception to a particular form of local governance arrangement we need an early decision in response to the davies commission report on airport capacity  it is due imminently  but ministers are already starting to kick it into the long grass  apparently they are only going to address this vital question at the end of this year at the earliest  we also need real announcements  in short order  on specific rail interconnectivity between towns and cities  those are some of the priorities that deserve urgent attention at the top of government will the chief secretary shed some light on the thinking of his great and glorious leader  the first secretary of state  or will we have to wait for this agenda to fit into a downing street soundbite before it gets any attention  i genuinely wish the chief secretary luck in gaining favour with the prime minister in waiting  because right now we have a chancellor distracted by his political ambitions who cannot even be bothered to debate productivity  let alone remember to mention it in his budget speech  britain cannot afford this issue being neglected any longer  and we will keep reminding the chancellor   when he is here   of his responsibilities until real action is taken 
 rose   
the key thing is the difference between the budget document and the budget speech  the budget speech was more than an hour long  so why did the chancellor not mention that very paragraph 
at least he is here 
we are looking for the right hon  gentleman’s support in commissioning the obr to look at the spending choices the chancellor has before him  he will have to acknowledge that certain decisions on reducing public expenditure could have more of an adverse effect on productivity than others  we want to make sure that we have a proper analysis of the impact of those decisions  that would be a better  more sensible way to think about how we spend  it is not just a debate about how much we spend 
will the minister give way 
will the minister give way 
 rose   
 rose   
 rose   
i thank the member for fulham for giving way  would he be so good as to look at the point he was making on transport infrastructure  i asked about the davies commission on airport capacity  which he knows is an issue affecting britain’s productivity as a whole  will he give us an assurance that the government will make a swift decision when presented with the final conclusions of the commission’s report  and not kick it into the long grass until the end of the year or beyond 
 urgent question   to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions if he will answer a question about the state of child poverty 
this morning’s statistics show a depressing slowdown in the progress that we should be making as a country towards the abolition of child poverty in the uk  will the secretary of state confirm that the numbersof children in absolute poverty have risen over his time in office  will he confirm that last year  19  of children were in absolute poverty  and that this year  19  of children are still in absolute poverty  will he also confirm that this year  17  of children were in relative poverty  and that there are still 17  of children in relative poverty today has the secretary of state dropped the ambition to end child poverty by 2020  this is not a time for complacency  the social mobility and child poverty commission has warned that there is now “no realistic hope” of that target being met  the prime minister says that he will be“judged on how we tackle poverty” so what is the government’s plan to catch up on the lost ground  will the secretary of state pause and reflect on the fact that nearly one in five children in this country is still growing up without some of the basics  we are talking about the lives of children up and down this country   about whether their parents can put money in the meter to keep their home warm in winter  and about whether they have something or very little for their tea the child poverty act 2010  which ministers opposite supported  placed one of the most important duties on the government  to ensure that in the 21st century  children do not grow up suffering deprivation or lacking the necessities that most of us take for granted  yet progress has now slowed to a snail’s pace  would it not be shocking if the government departed from the consensus that children should be free from such disadvantage by the end of this decade  i therefore ask the secretary of state to give a straight answer to the house today  does he remain committed to the child poverty act or not do not the government need a serious strategy to address low pay and boost productivity  they should be providing incentives for a living wage and new opportunities for high quality skills  as a more positive route out of poverty  but what does this secretary of state do when faced with an end to the progress in reducing child poverty  he threatens to cut £5 billion from the tax credits of children  which would mean 3 7 million working families losing  on average  £1 400 a year  that will not address child poverty  it will add to it does the secretary of state realise that it is parents who are already working who would be hit by such a decision  how does it help to make work pay to pull the rug from underneath them in that way  why is he trying to kid people into thinking that such a hit to incomes can be easily replaced  unless he is planning a rise of 25  in the minimum wage  that will not happen labour lifted more than 1 million children out of relative poverty and more than 2 million children out of absolute poverty  on the secretary of state’s watch  progress has stalled  is it true that  instead of developing policies to tackle low pay  the government  faced with statistics that show such poor progress  will try to erase the figure altogether  redefine the measure and pretend that the problem has gone away  is he really going to propose that statistical redefinition  the conservative party manifesto promised that they would“work to eliminate child poverty and introduce better measures to drive real change” nobody realised that meant that they would just change the measure  instead of shifting the goalposts when things get uncomfortable  ministers should take responsibility and tackle low pay  not attack the low paid 
these are serious times for greece and the eurozone  and there are risks for europe and the uk if an urgent resolution cannot be found  given that the greek banks are now closed  can i ask the chancellor about the immediate implications for the uk economy and british citizens  our exporters  pension funds and the 1 million british visitors to greece need to know that the uk government have a thorough contingency plan regarding the impact on british citizens in greece  how will holidaymakers travelling there this summer be able to obtain full information and updates about the best way to proceed  given the constantly changing situation  the chancellor touched on that in his statement  but will he tell us what discussions british officials have had with the greek authorities and banks to ensure that uk citizens will continue to be able to withdraw sufficient funds from the system  especially if the cash machines in greece are depleted of banknotes  will he also give us his assessment of the number of british citizens with deposits in greek banks  they will be anxious todayabout whether they can get their money  are the british embassy in athens and our network of consular staff adequately equipped to cope with all eventualities  do they have the resources to deal with inquiries from british citizens and companies in need of assistance turning to the impact on our economy and our financial system  there have been varying reports of the exposure of the british banking system to the greek economy  what discussions have the treasury and the bank of england had with financial institutions here and in the eu about the implications for our financial system  in particular  will the chancellor give us more details of the conversations he has had personally with the greek and other eurozone ministers  what has he been doing to urge them to find a solution i understand that the prime minister has today chaired a greece contingency committee  will the chancellor explain the day to day structure for monitoring emerging risks to the uk position  which institutions are leading on each aspect of events  and how are the government co ordinating our preparedness for any interventions that are needed  what assessment have they made of the number of british firms and the volume of exports potentially affected by the situation in greece and  in particular  of the exposure to export finance risk of firms awaiting payment although non eurozone countries are not directly involved in the negotiations with the greek government  the international monetary fund has of course provided £37 billion of support so far  about £1 7 billion of which has come from uk taxpayers  if there are wider ramifications for the eurozone economies in the months ahead  there will clearly be further risks for uk business and trade and for our economy  as the chancellor knows  british business is highly dependent on a healthy and sustainable european economy  but our trade deficit with the eu has worsened in recent times  does he agree that those vulnerabilities make it all the more urgent that we prioritise measures to boost economic productivity here in the uk as part of our defence against external economic turbulence  our exporters need support and assistance  and i urge him to include measures in next week’s budget to boost productivity and take account of their heightened susceptibility to such turbulence given the gravity of the problems facing greece and the wider repercussions for us and for the european economy  i believe that the chancellor should pause and reflect that it undermines his position to make bogus comparisons between greece and britain  nobody will take those comparisons seriously  the crisis in greece has been building up for many years now  and billions in bail outs have already been provided from eurozone economies  there has been considerable hardship for the greek people  who still face economic distress  does he agree that it is imperative for the institutions to continue to seek opportunities for a negotiated settlement with the greek authorities during the week ahead  and for the greek government to accept their part in charting a course towards a long term resolution and deal with economic reform and governance questions that cannot be ignored  this is surely a time for all concerned to pursue a responsible approach and avoid a disorganised and chaotic outcome that would be devastating for greece and have severe implications for the wider european economy 
yesterday’s referendum in greece presents the european union with the most fundamental test that it has faced for a generation  although the greek people have given their backing to their government  that does not overrule the position of other elected eurozone governments who are now faced with an incredible dilemma  it is imperative for the greek government and their creditors to sit down and plan for an orderly and pragmatic way forward  and to avoid impulsive and precipitate steps that could spark turmoil or chaos what are the chancellor and prime minister doing to press both sides to find a new timetable and some breathing space  at least to allow planning for all eventualities to take place  greece’s position in the euroand the european union affects us all  will the prime minister and the chancellor actively engage with both sides of this impasse and do what they can to help reach an agreement  is there more scope for proactive diplomacy  and will the chancellor say more about the substance of conversations that he has had with greek and other eurozone ministers since last week’s statement to the house  the chancellor needs to play his part  what is he saying to the international monetary fund  with whom we have direct influence  about emerging options for restructuring greek debt  last week the imf signalled that an alternative analysis was necessary  so can he clarify what course the british government are advising the imf to take let me ask the chancellor about some immediate issues affecting the uk  can he reassure the house that britain’s financial system is properly insulated against risks emanating from a possible greek exit from the euro  at a time of such heightened anxieties about banking across europe  can he explain why today he has announced a reduction in the level of protection for bank deposits in the uk  what can be done to help british firms selling goods or services to greece that might be awaiting payment because of the suspension of greek banks  he did not mention uk trade   investment in his statement  but what changes are being made to its advice and assistance at this time the chancellor mentioned the need for british tourists who are setting off on their summer holidays to ensure that they check advice from the foreign office  but can he reassure those who are travelling that the government are working closely with tour operators and airlines so that travel arrangements are not adversely affected by disruptions to the currency in greece  can he give the house more details about the capacity of the embassy and consular networks to stand ready to help with the volume of inquiries that are likely to ensue last night the president of the european parliament called on european union member states to prepare for a possible humanitarian intervention in the coming weeks  given that children and the sick and vulnerable in greece may feel the strain of any volatility in the basic operations of a normal economy  how are the british government responding to that  more broadly  will the chancellor acknowledge what the bank of england’s financial policy committee has noted in recent months   that our wider balance of payments problems and widening trade deficit over the past five years presents a potential vulnerability that should not be ignored  the minutes of the last financial policy committee meeting state that that“could  in adverse circumstances  trigger a deterioration in market sentiment towards the united kingdom ”wednesday’s budget must do more to help our exports and productivity so that our economy is strong enough to cushion any external turbulence that may arise finally  does the chancellor agree that both sides of this stand off still have much work to do  the eurozone countries need to do their best to offer greece the opportunity to return to negotiations  and the greek government need to face up to their responsibilities for stronger governance and economic reform  these are serious times for greece  for europe and for the united kingdom  especially if a disorderly chain of events now follows  i urge the chancellor to do what he can to prevent that scenario from occurring  but to prepare fully in case it does come to pass 
good morning  madam deputy speaker when one cuts through the rhetoric and the headlines that the chancellor spun  one sees that yesterday’s budget leaves working people worse off  it is the working families of britain on low incomes  trying their hardest to do the right thing  who will pay the price for the gap between what the chancellor said and the truth of what his budget actually means  the office for budget responsibility has flatly contradicted the right hon  gentleman’s claim to have lowered taxes  pointing out on the first page of its analysis that tax increases are twice as big any tax cuts over the course of this parliament  it is a budget that is entirely concerned with chasing headlines to further the chancellor’s well known political ambitions  rather than putting the working people of britain first pulling the rug from under people on low incomes with a hefty work penalty in the tax credits system    3 3 million working families will lose out from these changes  with 500 000 families losing tax credits entirely   despite tory denials before the election  will hurt those in work 
the hon  lady is very keen  and i give way to her enthusiasm 
i did not realise that the hon  lady was a conduit for the former labour chancellor of the exchequer  i will certainly look closely at what he said  but i did not hear him say those words this morning i want to ask ministers about the work penalty that they have introduced into the tax credits system  did they know before the election that they were going to hit those who needed tax credits to make work pay  or was it deliberately hidden from public view because of the shock that such a cut to incomes would create  this was a budget that exposed the chancellor’s skewed priorities   a budget that failed to build the more productive economy that we need  that ducked long term decisions on vital infrastructure projects  and that sought to substitute spin for the support people need to go to work 
i will give way to the very eager conservative members in a moment  but i want to make a little progress we do recognise that sensible savings are needed to get the deficit down  and we will support measures that tackle tax avoidance and control overall household benefit levels  we regret that the budget fails to address the overpayments and errors in welfare expenditure  which have ballooned in recent years during the welfare secretary’s time in office  let alone his lamentable record on delivering the mythical universal credit  for which so many people are still waiting  as my right hon  and learned friend the acting leader of the opposition said yesterday  we will be a responsible opposition  we will not oppose for opposition’s sake  and we welcome a number of the budget measures 
let me pick who i want to give way to  i give way to the hon  member for thornbury and yate 
i have not used those words  the hon  gentleman is reporting words that have apparently been said i believe it is important that the opposition today look at the spin and the headlines that the chancellor created in his budget yesterday  less than 24 hours later  the budget is beginning to unravel     interruption   have i said something wrong  the budget is beginning to unravel and i will explain why  but in the spirit of magnanimity i want to explain that there are budget measures that we welcome  the budget fails to address the long term challenges britain faces     interruption  
thank you  mr deputy speaker many parts of the budget were suggested by labour in recent months  abolishing permanent non dom status   that sounds very familiar to my hon  friends  increasingthe minimum wage   again  we have repeatedly called for that  we welcome any action on low pay   by the way  the conservatives opposed the creation of the national minimum wage in the first place   but this so called national living wage is unravelling as it becomes clear that it is nothing of the sort  it is the rebranding of an increase in the national minimum wage   as i say  labour created that in the first place   which  with the tax credit changes  will still leave working families worse off we will support steps to tackle tax avoidance   again  we have consistently pressed the government on that   but this chancellor has a poor record on hitting tax avoidance targets  with the amount of uncollected tax increasing to £34 billion last year and his so called tax deals continually failing to bring in the revenues he predicted  in yesterday’s budget  the conservatives broke their manifesto promise to deliver £5 billion of savings by 2017 18  the chancellor made that promise at the last general election  and he is now saying that we might perhaps get it by the end of this parliament  we will file the supposed £5 billion of tax avoidance measures in the “believe it when we see it” category 
my right hon  friend is right that we should be thoughtful about the government’s proposals  it is sometimes difficult to see through the political fog of the games that the chancellor is trying to play and the tactics he is trying to use  oh  the look of innocence on his face  my right hon  friend is right that it is important to take on questions of welfare reform and work through them methodically  we will not oppose everything just for the sake of it  my right hon  and learned friend  the acting leader of the opposition  was right to say yesterday that while that might be the temptation  we will look at the proposals and be reasonable about those we can support we welcome the steps taken in the budget to reduce pension tax relief for the highest earners  and of course the rise in the personal allowance threshold  as we support steps to cut taxes and try to get a better settlement for those in work 
the hon  gentleman was doing so well until the little barb at the end of his intervention  of course we want a situation   there is more politicalconsensus on this than people perhaps realise   in which people in work are better off than they otherwise would be  the problem  which i will come on to later  is the chancellor’s approach with this particular set of budget measures  he is pulling the rug from beneath people’s feet while higher wages are not yet available  when we look at the package as a whole  we see that people will be worse off during that period  he cannot just shovel that beneath the rug 
i want to make some progress  but i will give way again in a minute    interruption   i will give way now to the hon  member for rossendale and darwen  jake berry  if he wants to intervene    interruption   he complains that i am not giving way  but he does not want to intervene we will not support self defeating false economies in the government’s approach to social security  we do not support an approach that will leave more than 3 million working families poorer  and in turn mean that the poorest children are more likely to grow up into poor adults  which will cost society far more in the longer run the chancellor and ministers on the front bench have a track record when it comes to false economies  particularly during the last parliament  they scale back nurse training  and then spend a fortune hiring nurses from private agencies  as my hon  friend the member for denton and reddish  andrew gwynne  knows  they cancel major road schemes  such as the one involving the a14  and then revive them later on at vast expense  they pay redundancy to senior officials at the ministry of defence or the foreign office  and then rehire them at higher cost  they restrain local councils from tackling fraud in housing benefit  and then the level of overpayments escalates to £1 5 billion  they reduce the number of her majesty’s revenue and customs staff so that phone calls go unanswered from businesses that need to get through  and then are surprised when the tax gap gets wider and revenues go uncollected  and we have a chancellor with the gall to boast of a northern powerhouse while simultaneously pulling the plug on the electrification of major commuter rail lines 
it has been said many times  but the powerhouse has become a power cut  as time goes on  many   not just in the north but in the midlands   will see through the rhetoric to the reality that they are experiencing the government are undercutting  not supporting  a productive economy  it says everything about the chancellor that the impact of his budget has been to worsen the outlook for productivity in our economy over the rest of this parliament rather than to improve it  the obr hasdone the calculations and its prediction is on page 77 of its report  its conclusion is stark  the opposition know that more productive businesses  and a more productive economy  are the key to a virtuous circle of higher growth  higher living standards and  as a consequence  more effective deficit reduction  for the conservatives  productivity springs magically from thin air  but for us it is decent infrastructure and decent public services that can make all the difference to business success in his march budget  the chancellor did not even mention productivity  so perhaps we should be glad that he at least found time to mention it yesterday  even if we are still waiting for the much trumpeted productivity plan  i gather that it will be published on friday  although the house is not actually sitting that day so we will not be able to scrutinise the details  under this chancellor  uk productivity has  in the words of the office for national statistics  undergone a period of “unprecedented” stagnation 
i am astonished  a conservative member of parliament reports positive feedback on the chancellor’s budget  i never thought i would hear that  i am aghast 
i have not read the comments by the former chancellor  although i keep hearing about them from members  i will have a good look at them  but it is important that we scrutinise the government’s record on productivity  unless we improve productivity in our economy  we will not generate the revenues to deal with the deficit and raise living standards  in 2012 and 2013  our productivity growth was negative  and last year it was just 0 2   that compares to an average of 2 2  under the labour government from 1997 until the global financial crisis hit  it is  therefore  almost beyond belief that on the obr’s analysis the budget could lead to lower productivity growth  now estimated to be 0 4  lower than the forecast for next year  0 2  lower in 2017  0 1  lower in 2018 and 0 2  lower in 2019   productivity down next year  the year after  the year after that and the year after that 
government members will not be interested in scrutinising the compositional issues that are arising in our economy  but the share of jobs that are high skilled is shrinking back  according to the office for national statistics  and being replaced by an increasing share of low skilled jobs  that is definitely something to be concerned about  in fact  the obr has voiced its concerns about the productivity threat to our economy  saying “if productivity fails to recover as predicted but wage growth continues to accelerate  the mpc could be forced to raise interest rates more quickly”and wage growth will fall short of its forecast 
hold on  let us just pause to scrutinise that  i think the hon  gentleman just said that people should be grateful that they are having those tax credits taken away because that will free them up and make work pay     interruption   hon  members speaking from a sedentary position call those tax credits a perverse incentive  i just do not think they understand the lives of those on low pay who are struggling to make ends meet and who rely on the support that tax credits have been able to give  that work penalty is going to cause real problems 
that is very much our critique of the government today  of course we want a higher wage environment and of course we want those jobs to be there  but if we take away that support at that crucial moment  we are going to make people’s lives much  much harder 
i would like to make a little progress if i may  because a lot of members want to get in  in particular  i want to continue to focus on productivity  because there were a number of ways in which the chancellor’s budget fell short 
no  not yet there was no mention of science or research and development in the budget speech and no steps to increase mobility in the housing market  in fact  the obr says that 14 000 fewer affordable homes will be built by 2021  how on earth that helps to reduce the housing benefit bill  i do not know  at the same time  the government are delaying rail improvements  systematically decimating renewable energy investment and kicking the decision on airports into the long grass  there are tough choices to be made  and lower priorities where savings can be made  but the chancellor has failed to prioritise those public services that boost productivity  and that will cost the country more in the longer run seven budgets on  it is time that that this chancellor took some responsibility for his failure to eliminate the deficit this year  as he promised  for the drag on our economy and public finances caused by woeful performance on productivity  for the stagnation in living standards  and for the overruns in the social security budget  growth has been revised down by the obr  as has capital investment  these are incredibly difficult times for the wider global economy  but where is the urgent help to support our exports and productivity to tackle that other deficit  which has worsened significantly under this chancellor   
i shall give way in a moment  i just want to talk about the other deficit  the current account deficit  where our trade gap with the eu has worsened and our balance of payments problems have set alarm bells ringing at the bank of england  the chancellor’s priority should be to build up the productive capacity of our economy so we can pay our way in the world  but we are still too vulnerable to external turbulence  it should not be neglected in this way  britain’s current account deficit has widened to 5 9  of gdp  which the obr states is“the largest annual peacetime deficit since at least 1830” the obr also reveals that the chancellor is £367 billion short of his £1 trillion goal on exports that he promised by the end of this parliament 
is the hon  gentleman talking about the imminent leadership elections in the conservative party or the labour party  i do not know what is going to happen in the conservative party leadership contest  there were of course a few little jokes about the hon  member for uxbridge and south ruislip  boris johnson   and we will see how that pans out  i know that other cabinet ministers are a little concerned about the way that the budget panned out for them  it is going to be difficult for them over the next few years this was the chancellor’s second budget in four months  he said in march that that was his budget for the longer term  yet four months on he has delivered a different plan to a different agenda  he has been chopping and changing  with three different sets of figures in thepast nine months alone   so much for his consistency  we learned more about the chancellor and the nature of this government in one hour of his budget speech than we learned in the months of the election campaign  in march  when the work and pensions secretary was pressed about where their £12 billion of welfare cuts would fall  he said “as and when the time is right  we will make it very clear what our position is ”is it any coincidence that the time is right for these conservatives two months after an election rather than two months before it before the election  the conservative manifesto assured us that there would be only a two year freeze in working benefits  but yesterday the chancellor doubled that to a four year freeze in most working age benefits which will take £4 billion from households by 2020 21  that is one of the fastest broken promises in political history    interruption   there is an awful lot of noise from conservative members  i shall give way to the hon  member for richmond  yorks   rishi sunak  because he has been trying to intervene 
i think the hon  gentleman will find that we said in the election that we wanted to focus in particular on business rates  he will know from talking to small firms in his constituency that companies are concerned about the pressures on business rates  but where did the chancellor mention business rates in yesterday’s budget  we felt     interruption  
we felt at the election that it was more important to prioritise support for businesses through business rates than through a change in corporation tax   but we lost the election    hon  members  “hooray ”  conservative members feel the need to crow about these things  but the public will be concerned that they said one thing before the election and have done totally different things after it  yes  the conservatives did win a majority  but they hid their specific cuts from the electorate   they concealed them  it was a secret agenda  only now partly revealed 
i will not give way because conservative members are not being reasonable and letting me make progress with my speech the impact of the work penalty in the tax credits system should have been set out at the election  a lone parent with two children working 16 hours a week on the minimum wage would gain just over £400 from themove to the new national living wage  as the chancellor calls it  but would lose twice that   £860   from the change to tax credits next year  a couple on the minimum wage who work full time and have two children will gain £1 500 from the change to the minimum wage but lose over £2 200 next year from the changes to tax credits  as the government were hitting the low paid  the secretary of state for work and pensions was punching the air  working families did not vote for that  and they will not be fooled by the chancellor’s hollow words 
is the secretary of state going to punch the air    interruption   there we go 
i will give way to the right hon  gentleman again if he will confirm that the childcare promise  which was supposed to happen this summer  has been shelved until at least 2017  is that correct  i will give way to him  this is a debate  so i will give way to him  he wanted to talk about the case studies  he thinks it is     interruption  
the secretary of state has shot himself in the foot  he should read the small print of the chancellor’s announcement  without much fanfare  he left that childcare   
i have not finished    interruption  
it is quite entertaining to see the secretary of state struggle in this way 
wait for it  can the secretary of state confirm   
i relish giving way to the secretary of state  but he has to answer this question  we have given him a bit of time to think of an answer  he needs to explain the shelving of the childcare support  will the support come in this summer   yes or no 
so the secretary of state is saying that the childcare change will come in at the beginning of that financial year   in 2016  we have heard it from the secretary of state’s mouth  so it must be true  the childcare changes will come in in 2016  that is the announcement from the government  it is a bit of an improvement on the announcement we heard from the chancellor yesterday  who i thought said that the childcare changes were being pushed back to 2017 the reasons that the cost of social security is £25 billion higher than the conservatives expected are the underlying drivers of low pay  higher housing costs and insecure work  for all the chancellor’s spin  this is a budget that attacks the low paid and will leave many people in the lurch  unable to make ends meet  if the conservatives think a solution is to pull the rug from beneath the poorest  stigmatise claimants  rub out the statistics that measure child poverty and hope that the issue will go away  they are deeply mistaken we have to deliver a practical route out of poverty  provide a ladder of opportunity and view this challenge as integral to our long term economic prosperity  we must help people into decent jobs that can be sustained  cutting tax credits in this way and taking far more with the one hand than is being given with the other will leave too many people trapped on low incomes with low living standards  the ladder is being pulled away from those who want to get on  the achievement of the labour administration in significantly reducing child poverty staved off billions of pounds of longer term welfare expenditure  those who are in work pay taxes and improve the public finances as a result 
i have given way quite generously to government members and i would like to make some progress  if they do not mind the institute for fiscal studies confirms that the introduction of tax credits played an extremely powerful part in the movement in the child poverty figures  the conservatives cannot call themselves the party of working people  as they now do  when their budget leaves millions of working people worse off  how exactly does decreasing their work related assistance help those who become too sick to work and are on employment and support allowance  does that policy not run the risk of increasing the number of people who are placed in the more expensive esa support group  as has been the case in recent years  when the government have overspent by £4 5 billion on their original plans what motivation has a council tenant to get a better job and work for promotion if he or she is on the living wage and the government take that money awayimmediately  that is the crude nature of the rent rise that they are proposing  seeking a contribution from higher earners is  of course  important  and it is one solution  but  as the government’s own analysis pointed out before the election  going about it in the wrong way will result in perverse incentives and penalties for work this was more a budget of tax rises than a budget of tax cuts  a rise of more than 50  in the rate of insurance premium tax to raise £8 billion over this parliament will be a tax hit on the insurance for the family home  the family holiday and the family car  the new car tax will be a surprise that raises £1 5 billion by the end of this parliament  and   much to the secretary of state’s surprise   the government have shelved the childcare tax support that was due this summer until 2017  even if the secretary of state has now brought that forward by a year 
i do not think that was a very polite reaction from conservative members  my hon  friend worked very hard during her time in local government to try to support the low paid by introducing a london living wage  and i think it commendable that local authorities and businesses in london  in particular  have tried to make headway with that  of course  a real living wage now needs to be about £12 to compensate for the reduction in tax credits 
i will give way one final time  it is a very difficult choice  but the hon  member for havant  alan mak  seems particularly keen 
when we are writing our manifesto for the 2020 election  i shall give the hon  gentleman a call  i am afraid that we lost the most recent election  but i think it important for us to reflect on what the government propose and what the chancellor announced in hisbudget  it is our job as an opposition to make sure that his spin does not necessarily colour the view of the realities the budget statement revealed that the chancellor has the wrong priorities for britain  headlines for himself rather than help for low income households  we have a chronic shortage of affordable housing  and home ownership is increasingly out of reach for first time buyers  but the chancellor’s main housing policy was to reduce the number of affordable homes by 14 000  we need to encourage young people from poorer backgrounds to aim for higher education  but axeing student grants for the least well off   and  by the way  taking the cap off tuition fee rises  which was not particularly trumpeted by the chancellor   will make it harder  not easier  for them to do so this should have been a budget to support working people  and to tackle the long term challenges that our economy faces  the chancellor is already crowing at his own perceived success in the headlines  but his work penalty in the tax credit system will hit those in work  and leave working people worse off  the government have failed to make the big decisions that are needed to deliver the modern infrastructure that can make our businesses more productive  they have done nothing to address our alarming and widening trade deficit  and their rhetoric of a living wage has begun to unravel in less than 24 hours these are difficult times  and they require tough choices  the deficit needs to fall year on year  our debts need to be reduced  and sensible social security savings are also necessary  but this budget made the wrong choices for working people and prioritised political gains over the long term needs of our economy  as ever with this chancellor  it will be the british people who pay the price for his ambitions 
i am not “right honourable” 
let me be clear  we are glad to see an increase in the minimum wage  but the problem emerges with the one step forward  two steps backward strategy  we cannot consider this question in the round by just brushing away the work penalty that has been introduced into the tax credit system  the secretary of state must admit that people who depend on tax credits will lose out in the immediate period from april  is that the case 
i cannot be much clearer in my opposition to the work penalty to the tax credit system  i do not think that it is right at this time to hurt those who are in work and in low pay  of course we oppose the work penalty  but we support increases in the minimum wage  after all  it was our creation and something that labour campaigned on in the election  we are delighted that conservative members now feel that they can adopt that policy when they campaigned so vociferously against it 
indicated dissent 
 rose   
on a point of order  mr deputy speaker  it is important that the record is correct  i think the secretary of state said that the childcare provisions were coming in in 2016 and that this was not a delay to the planned date of 2015  am i right  mr deputy speaker 
was it always part of the chancellor’s long term plan to scrap the maintenance grants for students from lower income backgrounds  the institute for fiscal studies said this morning that this change“will raise debt for the poorest students  but do little to improve government finances in the long run ”can the chancellor tell us why this was not in his manifesto 
well  that fell a bit flat  i was asking about the chancellor’s manifesto and what he promised  taking away maintenance grants was always part of his plan wasn’t it  but he did not have the guts to tell students and their families before an election  however much he spins it  he is hitting students with more fees  more repayments and more debt   much more debt  will he confirm that the poorest students will graduate not with the current £40 000 of debt  but now with an average of £53 000 of debt
