it seems perverse to welcome the home secretary to her first outing at the dispatch box  given the awful and tragic circumstances that have led to this unscheduled appearance  but we wish her well in her demanding job  and i thank her for providing me with a copy of her statement in advance  i join her in sending condolences to the families and friends of those killed yesterday  and we send our heartfelt hope that those who have been wounded recover from their injuries  as she says  the police and the emergency services have performed magnificently  and on behalf of those on the labour benches  i  too  pay tribute to the dedication and skill of those involved i appreciate that the home secretary s ability to answer questions at this stage will be limited  given the ongoing police inquiries  so i will limit my remarks to a few areas on which i believe it may be fruitful to concentrate attention  as the home secretary said  my hon  friend the member for copeland  mr reed  is quite rightly with his constituents and cannot be with us in the house  i spoke to him yesterday and again this morning  and he makes the point that while we should not rush to change firearm laws  we should at least review them in the light of this case  does the home secretary agree in particular  we may need to focus on the question of follow up checks  does the home secretary think that they are adequate  and does she agree that there may be a need for a greater role for gps and the nhs  she will know that while there is a role for the applicant s family doctor before a firearms certificate is issued  there seems to be little involvement thereafter to ensure that the certificate holder s mental health  in particular  is not deteriorating cumbria constabulary is  i know  an excellent force achieving excellent results  i am sure that it will be examining the whole question of response times and whether there was anything more that it could have done in the dreadful circumstances with which it was presented yesterday  as the home secretary says  such incidents are thankfully rare  but she will know that since the mumbai massacre  our counter terrorism capability has put in place strategies to deal with such an eventuality  is she happy that the expertise and knowledge being assembled in this area is being disseminated across all forces  so that it can apply equally in a non terrorist related incident  which is what the incident in west cumbria appears to be  does she think that a small  rural force such as cumbria is properly equipped to deal with events that are more often predicted to happen in urban areas i was pleased to hear the prime minister s comments yesterday about doing anything that he could to help cumbria police  who have had to deal with a series of tragic events  the house will recall the death of pc bill barker last year in the dreadful floods that badly hit the area  i am pleased to hear about the help that the home secretary will provide through the special grant facility  that is indeed good news  presumably  she is confident that it will cover all that cumbria police need for the ongoing investigations  and indeed what they may need for counselling for those officers directly affected the prime minister also rightly praised the work of the nhs  and in particular west cumberland hospital  my hon  friends the members for copeland and for workington  tony cunningham  have today written to the secretary of state for health who  i am pleased to see  is present about the uncertainty over future funding for that hospital  that needs to be resolved quickly  the hospital s work is difficult enough at this time without those continuing problems finally  my hon  friend the member for copeland has asked me to express his thanks  on behalf of the community that he represents  for all the expressions of support that he has received from across the house  these are dark times for a strong and close knit community  renowned for the beauty of its surroundings and the warmth and friendliness of its people  they will recover from these recent tragedies  but the help and support of everyone in this house and of those whom we represent will be essential to that process  the home secretary can certainly be assured of our support as she seeks to find answers to the questions raised by these tragic events 
i hope the house will appreciate my being unable to respond to the contributions of all the old retreads  so to speak  as i want to concentrate on the remarkable standard of debate from those making their maiden speeches  and as there were 22 of them by my count  i shall have to go through them very quickly my hon  friend the member for darlington  mrs chapman  spoke movingly about the tragic case of peter chapman and the lessons to learn from it  the hon  member for stourbridge  margot james  was generous and gracious in her comments about her predecessor  lynda waltho  and spoke about the importance of the glass industry to her constituency  the hon  member for harrow east  bob blackman  spoke about his predecessor  tony mcnulty  who as a former police minister will  i guarantee  have been watching this debate on television all afternoon  the hon  gentleman described him as having been diligent in his work on behalf of his constituency  he also mentioned the royal national orthopaedic hospital  as the minister who approved the extra funding for the rebuild of that hospital  i too hope it goes through under this government having read the books of my hon  friend the member for stoke on trent central  tristram hunt   it was a delight to listen to his contribution  and i am sure we will listen to many more for many years to come  he spoke about there being the first new hospital in his constituency for 120 years  and gave a eulogy to the six towns  the hon  member for esher and walton  mr raab  spoke about the contribution his predecessor  ian taylor  made to science and technology  and spoke well too about his aspirational constituency  but pointed out that there are pockets of deprivation there as well  the hon  member for redcar  ian swales  spoke about the devastating effects of the closure of the steelworks there and mentioned his predecessor  vera baird  whom i guarantee is already campaigning vociferously against the government s proposals on anonymity for rape defendants my hon  friend the member for houghton and sunderland south  bridget phillipson  had the distinction of being the very first member to be elected to this parliament  she managed it on 6 may  by and large  the rest of us followed on 7 may  and some even later  she spoke of her first hand experience of working with the victims of sexual violence  once again putting that in the context of her opposition to the proposals on anonymity for rape defendants  the hon  member for oxford west and abingdon  nicola blackwood  mentioned her many illustrious predecessors and demonstrated what a suitable successor she will be  she was also the only member to mention domestic violence  which is an important issue in any home affairs debate my hon  friend the member for east lothian  fiona o donnell  managed to mention all three of her local newspapers  thus guaranteeing coverage  a good trick for those yet to make their maiden speeches  she also mentioned her predecessor  anne moffatt  who was my parliamentary private secretary both at the department of health and the home office and whom we all wish a speedy recovery following her serious illness the hon  member for northampton north  michael ellis  spoke about his constituency s worrying predilection for reselection  and showed why we all expect him to escape that particular curse  the hon  member for south swindon  mr buckland  delivered an excellent maiden speech after six years as the candidate  spending a long time waiting might  perhaps  be a good recipe for making such speeches  therefore my hon  friend the member for glasgow east  margaret curran  is a formidable campaigner whom i know very well  she is the first woman to be elected to represent glasgow east and is already displaying the benefits that she will bring to her constituents  i should also note that she made one further constitutional change by referring to you  mr speaker  as the presiding officer and to your deputies as the deputy presiding officers  the hon  member for amber valley  nigel mills  was the only member until my hon  friend the member for glasgow south  mr harris  to mention immigration  which he quite rightly said was one of the biggest issues on the doorstep during the general election my hon  friend the member for east kilbride  strathaven and lesmahagow  mr mccann  rightly mentioned adam ingram s contribution to the northern ireland peace process  the hon  member for hexham  guy opperman  spoke about the need to retain vibrant rural communities and the importance of housing to that objective  he did much for victim support before he came to this house  and i am sure he will do even more as a new member of it my hon  friend the member for west dunbartonshire  gemma doyle   in a funny speech  spoke about her pride at representing the constituency in which she was born and raised  she also mentioned the importance of the co operative movement  which she will see has been grasped by the government at least for the time being  the hon  member for rochester and strood  mark reckless  gave us an insight into the dark world of the government whips when he spoke about his predecessor  and he made an elegant argument on the importance of elected police commissioners every word of which i disagreed with the hon  member for eastbourne  stephen lloyd  had the unique experience of being told he had won when he had lost and lost when he had won  i think the whips may avoid him as a teller on any future vote we have  the hon  member for banff and buchan  dr whiteford  spoke impressively about how constitutional issues can be of immense importance to the more prosaic  day to day issues that affect our constituents  the hon  member for west suffolk  matthew hancock  spoke of the beauty of his constituency and of the work of richard spring  which many of us in this house admired  despite his obvious failure to secure a bypass for brandon the member for tory    interruption   i meant the hon  member for north east somerset  jacob rees mogg   i do like to remind myself which party they are from  he made a particularly entertaining speech  it was a little anti danish  but on the form he was on tonight  he will avoid having ox bones thrown at him during his time in this house finally  the hon  member for carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire  simon hart  need not have worried he maintained that very high standard to the last  he spoke about his sympathy for his family and friends  who have been here since 2 30 pm  i very much sympathise with that i know how they feel  given that he gave away the ending of the latest harry potter film  i think the hansard people are having their arms stretched up their backs to make sure it is not in tomorrow s  hansard for the benefit of the deputy prime minister  i will mention just three of the contributions from retreads  the right hon  member for haltemprice and howden  mr davis  and the hon  members for epping forest  mrs laing  and for chichester  mr tyrie  made perhaps three of the most eloquent speeches against the proposed 55  rule  government members ought to listen to that argument  i was also pleased that the deputy prime minister made his maiden speech at the dispatch box  we were very interested to hear that he has given her majesty s government s support to a yes vote in the welsh referendum on further devolution in wales  i think we all took that as being a step forward 
i just do not accept what my hon  friend has said  this is the new politics  and what is said from the government dispatch box will be carried out  i have every faith in the deputy prime minister and that he will ensure that he sticks by his word on this issue may i welcome the home secretary 
ah  i give way to the deputy prime minister 
i am not sure whether that can be recorded as a slip of the tongue  i think that the right hon  gentleman has made the first u turn  i believe he also thought that the basic state pension was £33 a week that was probably a basic slip of the tongue too  this is not a good start for the deputy prime minister  because labour members were behind him in his stated preference for the government to support a referendum on devolving power in wales  we shall see what happens  but my hon  friend the member for wrexham  ian lucas  was right in what he said i welcome the home secretary to the dispatch box  labour members like to think that we smoothed her path to this position as home secretary by helping to remove the former shadow home secretary  the hon  member for epsom and ewell  chris grayling   before he could do any significant damage  among his many gaffes was a propensity to be disingenuous about crime statistics  which led to his having his knuckles severely rapped by the uk statistics authority  he is now in the political equivalent of a siberian salt mine  locked away somewhere in the department for work and pensions and condemned to work with a lib dem  the hon  member for thornbury and yate  steve webb   about whom the deputy prime minister once said the following this may also have been a slip of the tongue  webb must go   he s a problem  i can t stand the man  we need a new spokesman  we have to move him  but   as a backbencher  he d be a pain in the  a word beginning with  a  follows  but if i said it  mr speaker  you would be off yours to call me to order  it seems to me that the prime minister and the deputy prime minister managed to sort out both their little problems at the expense of the dwp i am confident that the new home secretary will not repeat the mistakes of her predecessor as shadow home secretary and that she will confirm  in her reply  that crime has reduced substantially since her party left office in 1997  on violent crime  she will be able to correct the mistake made on page 55 of the conservative manifesto  which said that violent crime   has risen sharply under labour  it should  of course  have said  reduced  instead of  risen   there are three measures of violent crime  the british crime survey s figures  which show a decline of 41   the recorded crime figures  which  since the 2003 changes in the formulation  have shown a 13  reduction  and the figures from accident and emergency departments collated by cardiff university  to which my right hon  friend the member for cardiff south and penarth  alun michael  drew attention  that show a reduction of 15  since they commenced in 2001  the murder rate is at its lowest for 20 years and the murder rate in london is at its lowest since 1978  no incoming home secretary in living memory has inherited such a consistent fall in crime and no incoming government could have done more to undermine that position in their first few weeks on 19 may  in her speech to the police federation  the home secretary said make no mistake  i will be tough on crime  but she could give no commitment to retain the record number of police and police community support officers who are vital to that objective  how is it that under this conservative led government the funding for international development can be guaranteed but the funding for fighting crime cannot  labour would have protected them both  do her government consider international development a greater priority  how is it that while front line services in health and education can be safeguarded  police numbers cannot  will she stand up for her department against such warped priorities  when will she ensure that  similar to what happens in health and education  the savings made within constabularies are reinvested in front line policing  how will she be tough on crime while restricting the police s ability to catch criminals the government talk of adopting the safeguards of the scottish system in respect of dna retention  but they do not explain whether those are safeguards for the victims or the perpetrators of crime  the scottish system retains the dna of those arrested but not convicted  but only if they are arrested for a serious crime  that would be logical only if there was evidence to suggest that it was people in that category who had a higher propensity to be re arrested  but the best available evidence indicates that the type of offence a person is first arrested for is not an indicator of the seriousness of the offence he or she might subsequently be arrested or convicted for in future my hon  friend the member for mitcham and morden  siobhain mcdonagh  and my right hon  friend the member for don valley  caroline flint  have made these points  but let me remind the house that  each year  in about 800 cases of rape  murder and manslaughter  dna is central to police inquiries  in about 10  of those cases  matches are made to people who have been arrested but not convicted  of which a quarter involve people who have been arrested but not convicted of non serious offences  that is one reason why in 2008 09  the england and wales dna database had a 13  higher success rate than scotland s on the period of retention  there is no evidence to support the scottish period of three years  which was plucked from the air  the best evidence available shows that the so called hazard curve the propensity for those who have been arrested but not convicted to be re arrested remains higher than that for the rest of the population for six years following first arrest  as my right hon  and learned friend the leader of the opposition said in the debate last week  the government should give the benefit of the doubt to the victim      official report  25 may 2010  vol  510  c  43  the retention period of six years should remain in force until 2012  when we will have  for the first time  six years  worth of statistics upon which to make a further judgment  why pull that information off the dna database and then find in 2012 that we should have kept it the home secretary intends to be tough on crime while failing to protect police numbers and restricting their ability to catch criminals  and she intends to do that while embroiling them in the operational upheaval of having elected commissioners  aside from the fact that that will lead to years of internal turmoil and cost about £50 million for each police authority area  that idea s time has gone  the debate on accountability has moved on  it is now focused on making neighbourhood police teams answerable to the public they serve  on doing more to ensure that police authorities have a higher profile and more expertise  and  crucially  on enhancing and increasing the role and responsibilities of local government  notwithstanding the comments of the hon  member for rochester and strood  mark reckless   local authority leaders from all three main parties oppose this measure  as do the association of chief police officers and the police federation  i have yet to meet a single police officer or local councillor who supports it  the measure is  as acpo says  driven purely by dogma  and i urge the home secretary to think again before taking it further in the time available to me  i cannot deal with every issue that has been raised  but i should like to make a final point  we will discuss identity cards on wednesday on second reading of the identity documents bill  but the deputy prime minister has  in a hyperbolic speech that my right hon  friend the member for blackburn  mr straw  has already pointed out was historically inaccurate  promised the end of the  culture of spying  on british citizens  praying in aid id cards  the national identity register and cctv we are told that cctv is part of the evil infringement of our rights and that it must therefore be  properly regulated   to use the deputy prime minister s words  will the home secretary tell us what that means  and will she say if she has ever been approached by a constituent who wants fewer cctv cameras  that is important  because  apparently  as part of the big society  which is what most of us thought we would get if we failed to tackle obesity  the deputy prime minister promises to ask the public which laws to repeal  we stand on the side of the home secretary s constituents  an article in the maidenhead advertiser  entitled  cctv will help stop crime in furze platt   which is in her constituency  says  almost every resident of bridle road  bridle close and calder close has signed a petition asking the council to put cctv cameras in  as a deterrent   we are on the side of furze platt  indeed  the term could be used as cockney rhyming slang  as in  the deputy prime minister must be a right furze platt if he thinks people want fewer cctv cameras the conservative led administration will either recognise the need for control orders  second generation biometric passports  the detention of families and the dna database  or they will endanger our national security  weaken our controls on immigration  reduce our ability to return failed asylum seekers and restrict the police s ability to catch dangerous criminals  the gracious speech gave no indication that they recognise those basic facts 
will the home secretary please confirm now she has seen the statistics  now there can be no ambiguity about it that crime has gone down by 41 per cent  since 1997  violent crime is down  burglary is down  theft is down  domestic violence is down  murder rates are down  will she confirm that that is the case 
does the home secretary recall that the labour party s manifesto in 2005 had a commitment to introduce a voluntary id card scheme  does she recollect that it was the labour party that won that general election  in what way was it illegitimate or  indeed   stupid   to quote my hon  friend the member for vauxhall  kate hoey  for people then to buy a card that was legitimate and had been set out in the manifesto of the winning party 
this is arrogance 
i feel honoured  mr  deputy speaker  to be the subject of your first pronouncements from the chair  it will be a pleasure to serve under you we on the labour benches will not vote against the bill on second reading  although we do not think the general election was in any way a referendum on id cards  we accept that the conservatives and the liberal democrats have a mandate to abandon the measure  we believe that the 15 000 cards already in use should continue to be a legitimate form of identity  and that those citizens who have purchased them should not be treated in the unfair and arrogant way that the home secretary proposed  it is arrogant to punish the public because the government believe that the public were duty bound to presume a conservative victory at the general election  that is constitutional nonsense and i have never heard anything so arrogant from a political party in my life we think a version of the national identity register must continue to exist in some form  and that second generation biometric passports need to go ahead  however  we will pursue those arguments in committee and at other stages of the bill s passage in recent times  my party has been consistently in favour of an identity card scheme  the liberal democrats have been consistently opposed and the conservatives have been inconsistent to the point of perversity  the bill before us to abandon a voluntary identity card scheme  which the right hon  lady says is intrusive  bullying and unbritish  was in the first semi conservative i suppose we could call it queen s speech for almost 14 years the irony is that the previous queen s speech under a tory administration  in november 1996  included a bill to introduce a voluntary id card scheme  following extensive public consultation by the then home secretary  michael howard  who said that the potential benefits fell into two categories  it is worth repeating them to the house  this was a conservative government  proposing a bill at the queen s speech     interruption     fifteen years ago   says the minister for immigration  we will get on to what has changed in the almost 15 years since 1996  and how the problems that led that conservative government to put forward an  unbritish  bullying and intrusive  bill have actually worsened in the ensuing period  however  michael howard summed up the benefits succinctly  noting first  the direct benefits to the individual holder  e g  through use of an identity card as a travel card or to provide reliable proof of identity including for commercial transactions   and  secondly  the wider benefits to all citizens   e g  by reducing the level of certain crimes or by providing more efficient or less costly provision of state services   that description of the benefits is as accurate today as it was then  the consultation under the conservative government found that 64  of the public supported id cards  with 36  opposed  and the last tory government to be elected to power in their own right perhaps the last in more ways than one proceeded to include the measure in the gracious speech 
my hon  friend should write and tell them that the government believe this government  who believe in the big society and in listening to people that the scheme into which they bought  which parliament approved at every stage and which was in the 2005 manifesto of the party that was elected to government  is somehow illegitimate  his constituents should realise that it was their mistake in not presuming a victory for the tory party at the recent general election  that seems to be the reason that description of the benefits to which i referred is accurate  and the consultation carried out by the previous conservative government showed overwhelming public support  the labour government resuscitated the proposals and subjected them to a fresh  six month public consultation and further scrutiny in the form of a draft bill in 2003  the select committee on home affairs held a simultaneous inquiry  and the outcome of all that was  again  overwhelming public support 
that is to be determined by the party  however  we cannot suggest that we did not lose the election  we cannot simply oppose every measure that the government propose  we have to ensure that we consider the will of the people  i do not doubt that the mandate of the two parties in government allows them to introduce the measure before us  but they are absolutely wrong to cancel the national identity register  to say that they will not go ahead with second generation biometric passports and  most of all  as my hon  friend the member for stoke on trent south  robert flello  said  to take such an arrogant and dismissive approach to the british public the home secretary said that id cards would be made a footnote to history  so let us carry on with the history  the conservative government proposed id cards and undertook public consultation  labour resuscitated the proposal  the home affairs committee supported it  public scrutiny supported it  and the draft bill gained overwhelming support i should at this point mention the strange episode of the ten minute bill in january 2002  when the then member for broxtowe  now sadly no longer a member  proposed leave to introduce an identity card bill  the house will know that on a ten minute bill only the die hard supporters of a proposition will turn up to vote  but among that bunch of id card zealots  those people who wanted an  unbritish  intrusive and anti democratic  scheme  we find the former shadow home secretary  now the minister of state  department for work and pensions  the hon  member for epsom and ewell  chris grayling   the current leader of the house  and a whole bunch of their conservative colleagues to listen to the home secretary speak today  one would never believe that she once walked through the aye lobby in support of id cards  i have to reveal that she did  members should listen to her speech today  or read it again in  hansard  and then recall that the home secretary supported second reading of the identity cards bill on 20 december 2004  and she was not a tory rebel  she voted with her party in support of that bill  whose measures she now seeks to repeal  the conservatives continued to give their support  indeed  they supported it under the leadership of michael howard at the 2005 general election the right hon  lady now says that people were foolish to go out and buy id cards  but both main parties at that general election supported id cards  so the proposition that they should be removed is quite extraordinary  the conservatives continued to give their support right into the 2005 general election  when labour s winning manifesto pledged to provide citizens with a   secure identity card to protect them   from identity theft and clamp down on illegal working and fraudulent use of public services  why does the home secretary now believe that it was an infringement of civil liberties  the cause of the end of civilisation as we know it  when she voted for that precise scheme in 2004 
the tuc is a lot of things  but it is not a paymaster  i was not aware that brendan barber had said that  but if that is his view he is perfectly entitled to express it  i am setting out the views of the current home secretary and the conservative party on second reading on 20 december 2004 of the bill whose measures they now seek to repeal  indeed  they are not just seeking to repeal that legislation  but describing in extraordinarily derogatory terms anyone who supported it i quoted our precise manifesto commitment in 2005  we were in the course of carrying out that commitment  and everyone recognised that it would be a long process  but it began with the tories  enthusiastic support at the 2005 general election  and ended with their bitter opposition  how do we explain the conservative party s change from hard headed pragmatists to the political wing of liberty  in respect of the issues that galvanised the conservatives to act in the 1996 queen s speech and support the identity cards bill on second reading in 2004  the only change is that the problems that they sought to address have become more acute the mantra of the conservatives and the liberal democrats is civil liberties  but the home secretary should remember that when we talk about civil liberties our basic freedoms we are not talking solely about the rights of individuals but about the rights of society as a whole  we are talking about the right to be able to travel freely  the right to have access to efficient and effective public services  and the right to live our lives free from crime  id cards  biometric passports and the national identity register that supported them were designed precisely to protect those freedoms  but at the same time to help to increase security the security of each individual s identity  the security of our borders and  yes  an added layer of security in the fight against terrorism the home secretary might like to be aware  because she mentioned it  that it was not me who first pointed out the link with terrorism it was the right hon  member for haltemprice and howden  mr davis   who is  i confess  not normally guilty of any inconsistency  during the second reading debate in 2004  he said  as shadow home secretary at this very dispatch box  i would not have countenanced id cards before 11 september  after that  however  i accept that we must consider them  after 11 september  it is incumbent on all of us to examine carefully any measures that might enhance the nation s security  identity cards introduced properly and effectively may help to do that      official report  20 december 2004  vol  428  c  1953  that is what he said as shadow home secretary 
 rose 
i apologise to my right hon  friend in this broad coalition  but i do not have time to quote the whole speech  of course he made those points in that very important debate  after which the tories walked through the aye lobby with us  i do not agree that the tests were not met  my point  however  is that the conservatives are now in government  they can carry out the proposal that was in the queen s speech in 1996 and meet the tests that they set that debate took place on 20 december 2004  three years after 9 11 and  unfortunately  seven months before 7 7  and before the airline bomb plot  the liquid bomb plot  and all the other terrorist outrages that we have had to counter  the right hon  gentleman cannot say that anything has changed in relation to national security except that these problems are more acute  we are at a severe level of readiness  no one on the government benches can say   well  things have changed since 1996   or since 2004  they have changed they have got worse  and that has made the case for id cards stronger 
i will make some progress and then give way of course  for the government  as the home secretary said  it is conveniently symbolic to have this debate so early on in this session of parliament  it is a symbolic act to prove that the coalition can actually agree on something  as it certainly cannot agree on europe  the alternative vote  or even the human rights act it is certainly true that the prime minister and the deputy prime minister have been consistently smug in suggesting that a simple id card scheme will mean the end of civilisation as we know it  not for nothing are the prime minister and the deputy prime minister known as the self righteous brothers  although they are bound to have lost that loving feeling before too long  the deputy prime minister has a dutch mother and a spanish wife  so he should know that the claim that id cards are an affront to liberty and freedom would be greeted with bemusement in holland  spain  france  finland  sweden  italy  switzerland  germany and all the other countries that have managed to provide their citizens with the cards  pragmatic advantages without becoming despotic oligarchies the bill has provisions to keep the clauses of the 2006 act that relate to false documentation  and we welcome that  but we need much more than penalties for false documents if we are to win the fight against identity fraud and illegal immigration 
that is a very good point  no  it was not my intention to make the cards compulsory  indeed  we made it absolutely plain that people could use their biometric passport as an identity document or use an id card  which was a smaller  simpler  cheaper version  france has a voluntary id card scheme  as do many countries in europe that would not go to the compulsory stage  and it helps people to protect and prove their identity  which is the fundamental reason behind it  as i said  it was the right hon  member for haltemprice and howden who mentioned the link with terrorism  not moi 
my hon  friend makes a very powerful point  he has a good track record in this area  he is highlighting the real issues of civil liberties  which are not only to do with a simple identity card to prove and protect identity but a whole range of other issues that i shall come to in a moment 
no  i need to make some progress if we want to travel abroad  take an internal flight  open a bank account  take up a new job  register with a doctor  get a driving licence or get married  we need to prove our identity  no one would dispute that it is perfectly reasonable to have to provide proof of identity in such circumstances  for those who voluntarily acquire an id card  it enables them to prove who they are quickly  easily and securely  it provides a universal and simple proof of identity and a convenient end to the disorganised use of a year s worth of photocopied bank statements that people have to hand over phone bills  birth certificates and so on  all copied to numerous different places because of the ways that people have to prove their identity  the conservatives agreed about that almost unanimously in 1996 and again in 2004  for those lucky enough to be blessed with youthful good looks like you and me  mr deputy speaker it also provides proof of age  for those who are less well off  it provides a cheap and convenient alternative to a passport for european travel  it enables people easily to access the services to which they are entitled  the fact that a robust and trusted form of identification can be a tool for empowerment is something that the government have ignored in all their posturing on civil liberties 
yes  france there was nothing big brotherish about the system that we were implementing  we already have the nhs database for those registered with gps  incidentally  i note from yesterday s  independent i do not know whether it is true  but if we have read it in the papers  it probably is that the government have reneged on their pledge to scrap that database  we already have the driver and vehicle licensing agency database for those with a driving licence and the passport database with information on 80  of the people in this country exactly the same information as is on the id card all that we want to do is make it easier for banks  gps and employers to verify someone s identity and thereby make it much more difficult for people to create multiple identities and commit identity fraud  that crime costs our economy £1 2 billion every year and has increased by 20  in the first quarter of this year alone  combating identity fraud protects the security not just of individuals but of all of us collectively  drug dealers  people traffickers and terrorists depend on access to false documents  having no simple method of establishing and recording someone s identity simply plays into their hands  as the police have said in numerous submissions  as the conservative party stated in its pronouncements before the 2005 election and as the public have said in every consultation held by governments of both persuasions over the past 14 years  the introduction of id cards was linked to the switch to biometric passports  with all the costs intertwined  the national identity register is crucial to both  for reasons that i shall explain in a moment 
the hon  gentleman raises an important point  which has rather bedevilled this debate  as the right hon  member for haltemprice and howden well knows  there was a confusion among the public and politicians about whether the scheme would be compulsory or voluntary  and the whole debate in 2004 and subsequently was about whether future parliaments would have the opportunity to declare the scheme compulsory  it would have taken a vote of parliament  but yes  that was implicit in the legislation in the debate on 20 december 2004  charles clarke  who is sadly no longer in the house  said in his very first address to the house as home secretary   don t vote for this bill if you don t want to see id cards become compulsory   the current home secretary voted for the bill  i can only imagine what she would say if we proposed a compulsory id cards scheme  having heard her rhetoric about how a voluntary scheme is the end of civilisation  however  she voted for that scheme on the clear statement of the then home secretary that members should vote for it only if they wanted it to become compulsory  i disagree with a compulsory scheme and believe that we can have simple proof and protection of people s identities without it becoming compulsory second generation biometric passports  planned to commence in 2012  would provide a crucial additional level of security  enabling verification that the person presenting a passport had the same fingerprints as those encoded on the chip  amazingly  the liberal democrats appear to have convinced the tories in their political pre nup to scrap second generation passports 
my hon  friend pre empts a crucial point that i shall come on to in a moment there was no mention of scrapping second generation biometric passports in the conservative manifesto  in fact  the tories have not only been in favour of biometrics but wholeheartedly and enthusiastically in favour of them  the hon  and learned member for harborough  mr garnier  summed up the matter in 2007 when he said  there is not a conservative member   who disagrees with the notion that there should be biometric passports      official report  5 february 2007  vol  456  c  671  the prime minister himself has admitted that there is a need for the use of biometrics on passports  why the change of heart when we know that by locking people to one identity using advanced passport technology  we would help protect our country against the use of multiple identities by criminals  illegal immigrants and terrorists  why  given that updating our passports would bring us in line with the rest of europe  which has already set minimum passport standards to include facial and fingerprint biometrics  do we intend to allow our country to become an easy target for illegal immigration and our citizens to be subject to onerous checks at airports and ferry ports around the world  we had already introduced facial recognition image biometrics in british passports in 2006  but now the countries in the schengen agreement are going further and the us has already imposed a fingerprint requirement on all visitors who have not historically required a visa in other words  those from the uk i turn to the important point that my hon  friend the member for stoke on trent south raised  in march  when i was home secretary and sitting alongside the then foreign secretary  my right hon  friend the member for south shields  david miliband   the house heard about the inquiry carried out by the serious organised crime agency  at the request of the dubai authorities  into how 12 people with joint uk israeli citizenship had had their passports cloned without their knowledge  those were pre biometric passports  second generation biometrics would make such cloning impossible  indeed  the current foreign secretary  who was then shadowing the position  when that statement was made  said  the foreign secretary said that the biometric passports introduced four years ago are more difficult to counterfeit  does he consider these new passports to be as invulnerable to counterfeiting as it is possible to make them  or will the government review whether any other steps are needed to protect the integrity of british passports  is there any suggestion that british passports are more vulnerable than those of other countries  including other eu countries      official report  23 march 2010  vol  508  c  135  no  there was not such a suggestion then  but there is now that  amazingly and incredibly  this government are planning to abandon second generation biometric passports and leave our country more vulnerable to attack  it is beyond me to understand how the new home secretary could have been lulled into that decision  identity fraud  illegal immigration  terrorism and organised crime are international problems  and it makes sense for britain to continue working with our international neighbours to tackle them  biometric passports are part of an international drive to make travel documents more secure  their electronic security features  including fingerprints  are a significant impediment to forgers and counterfeiters  and we need to keep pace with our neighbours if the uk passport is to continue to be recognised as having the highest integrity 
that intervention was not worth waiting for  we put considerable effort into securing our borders  as he represents dover  he will know that the chief constable of kent has seen the number of illegal immigrants roving around the county reduced by 92  since my right hon  friend the member for sheffield  brightside and hillsborough  mr blunkett  went over and did a deal with sarkozy  who was then the interior minister  and shut down sangatte  we have taken every measure possible  if the hon  gentleman is interested in the security of his constituents in dover  i tell him that i am talking about the current government abandoning second generation biometric passports  probably on the basis of a decision at the hippy commune known as the liberal democrat conference  that is an incredible decision on funding  the government claim that scrapping the scheme will produce an initial £84 million in savings in the next four years  i would be extremely interested to learn how the home secretary came to that figure  on none of the statistics i saw when i was doing her job only three weeks ago does that make sense  seventy per cent  of the start up costs for id cards are linked to first generation biometric passports  to ensure that they fall into line with international standards  those costs are unavoidable and the money is committed  so where does the £84 million come from 
indeed and for the grand sum of £1 million  which she will save by not giving pensioners and students their money back on the cards they acquired because they had the temerity not to forecast a conservative victory at the general election  we will question that more closely in committee 
that is a sensible suggestion  except that some people who have id cards do not have passports  they are part of that 20  of the population who generally will not have a driving licence or bank account  we used to call them the socially excluded indeed  the government are supposed to be wedded to the idea of helping them and many of them will not have that facility because they do not have a passport  but my hon  friend s point is relevant  and i shall address it further shortly 
my hon  friend might get an answer to that from the home secretary  perhaps those staff should not have had the temerity to take those jobs  because they should have known that the conservatives were going to win the next general election  this is the new  bizarre world in which we are living abolishing the national identity register would save very little for three reasons  first  all the information held on our existing passport database will continue to be held  secondly  that information will need to be held securely  as it is now  and thirdly  we will still need to collect and securely hold the fingerprints of foreign nationals on a database the government s claim that scrapping id cards will save £800 million in operating costs over the next 10 years is utter fantasy  we always proceeded on the basis of full cost recovery and made it perfectly clear that over 10 years  the operating costs of id cards would be recovered through fees  so there would be no charge on general taxation over that period  however  if there are no id cards  there is no charge for id cards  and therefore no way of recovering the costs  by cancelling the scheme  the government remove the income stream but leave the cancellation costs  which the taxpayer will be forced to pay  and let us not forget the continuing cost to the economy of fraud  abuse of the nhs  illegal immigration and unauthorised working  by cancelling the scheme  the government will make not a saving  but a substantial loss 
that precise point has been made by liberty  which opposes id cards     interruption    an hon  member says that liberty does not make that point  but it does  on the basis that id cards for foreign nationals will be compulsory  although it is a card with fingerprints and biometric identification  we cannot now call it an id card  which is really silly it must be called a  permit  or  warrant  or some such thing  liberty says that either everyone should have a card  which is novel for liberty  or no one should have one 
i will not give way because i am about to conclude my final point is that the government intend not only to stop issuing cards  but to make the 15 000 already in circulation illegal  i find that despicable  and i do not think that that is too strong a word  how can any government seek to punish hundreds of thousands of its citizens for having the temerity to take advantage of a scheme that was pledged in a manifesto  supported in law and introduced in an entirely legitimate way      interruption    the home secretary is chuntering from the front bench  but i will gladly take an intervention 
fifteen thousand is a significant number of people     interruption    on monday  the deputy prime said that he had made a slip of the tongue when he told one of my hon  friends that the government will certainly campaign for a yes vote in a welsh referendum to devolve powers to wales  and i think i am entitled to make a similar slip of the tongue  of course i am talking not about hundreds of thousands of people it would have been if the scheme had gone on a few months longer but thousands  and 15 000 is a significant number of people those in possession of identity cards ought to be able to continue to use them as a legitimate form of identification  and to travel in europe and access services  at the very least  they should receive a refund  or the government should take up the suggestion of my right hon  friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east  paul goggins  and offer a discount off future purchases  the government should be ashamed of themselves for even thinking that they could treat people with such off hand arrogance  and they must look again at that aspect of the bill the opposition remain unconvinced by the government s arguments for scrapping id cards  the money saved will not pay for 3 000 extra police officers  as the lib dems claimed  in the long term  the proposals will cost us more money  hamper the efforts of the police to tackle identity fraud  and weaken rather than defend civil liberties  illegalising cards that have already been issued will penalise those who bought them in good faith  including pensioners and students  scrapping second generation biometric passports will threaten our borders and encourage illegal immigration  because our passport technology will lag behind that of our european neighbours  i urge the government to rethink this expensive  misguided and spiteful little bill 
i would be interested at some stage to learn the home secretary s views on the issue  because it is a crucial one both for the home department and for equalities  the lord chancellor told the house the other day that he had voted for anonymity in 2003  i voted against it  and that is still my view  but at some stage i would like to know the home secretary s view as for the minister  she will know that the prime minister recently told the house when he replied to a question on the issue that baroness stern had found that 8 to 10  of reported rape cases could result in false allegations      official report  9 june 2010  vol  511  c  329  the minister should know that the stern report made no such finding and that what baroness stern recommended was independent research to study the frequency of false allegations of rape compared with other offences  does the minister agree that the government ought to be implementing that recommendation  instead of proposing to introduce anonymity 
according to the british crime survey  the incidence of domestic violence has decreased by 64   since 1997  does the minister agree that the british crime survey is the best measurement of long term crime trends 
i thank the right hon  lady for a copy of the statement  i am pleased that she has come to make the statement to the house  however  i had already seen the statement she has just made because it was handed to me by a journalist this morning at 11 15 obviously  the home secretary originally intended to lay a written ministerial statement today  indeed  the title was laid last friday  this morning i sought that written ministerial statement  i was told that the home office was having a press conference prior to issuing the written ministerial statement something unknown in my time as a minister  therefore  i sought the written ministerial statement again  at 11 15 am a journalist who had been to the press conference handed to me a written ministerial statement that is almost precisely the statement that the right hon  lady has just made i hope the home secretary takes the matter seriously  as i am sure you will agree  mr  speaker  members of the house have a right to see written ministerial statements before they are circulated to the media the home secretary s announcement represents nothing more than a small adjustment to the points based system  it was spun to the media over the weekend as a profound adjustment to net migration  migration to this country has gone up  if the prime minister were talking to his french and german colleagues  he would know that there were 4 million migrants in germany  4 million in france and about 1 5 million in this country  since the 1990s  the last time the conservatives were in power  there has been a huge explosion of migration around the world  as the un has detailed yes  migration has gone up since the last time the conservatives were in power  but will the right hon  lady confirm that net migration has fallen substantially over the past three years  will she confirm that tier 1 migration the most highly skilled fell by 44  in the first quarter of this year  what is the problem with skilled migration that she seeks to resolve  will she also confirm that the number of asylum seekers has fallen to the levels last seen in the early 1990s a third of their peak  and the same peak everywhere else in europe  we are 15th in europe regarding the number of asylum seekers per head of population will the home secretary continue to support the points based system that we introduced  which ensures that no unskilled worker can come to this country the door has been closed on tier 3 for the past two years and that skilled workers under tier 2 can come to this country only if their sponsoring employer has advertised that job in jobcentre plus for four weeks prior  can she confirm that she intends to continue with those measures  which we introduced how many skilled workers will be denied entry to the uk under that temporary cap  and what percentage of total net migration will that represent  what makes the home secretary think that the uk can avoid the problems the us experienced when president bush introduced a quota on skilled migrants  with disastrous consequences and a whole series of readjustments 10 years ago  can she give an example of the problems caused to our society by skilled migrants coming to the uk under the current flexible arrangements what effect does the right hon  lady think her announcement today will have on population growth  over the weekend i heard government members speculate that this morning s announcement this trivial adjustment  will somehow ensure that our population avoids reaching 70 million  does she believe that  if so  how does she think that that will happen given that this measure has been conservative policy since the less progressive  are you thinking what we re thinking   days of their 2005 manifesto  why have they as yet failed to come up with a figure for their pre determined quota  does the right hon  lady intend to implement fully labour s tough measures to deal with the abuse of tier 4  the student route  which  along with spousal visas and eu migration  will be totally unaffected by the cap she has announced today today s announcement will affect fewer than one in seven migrants to this country  and those whom it will affect are the migrants our economy needs the most  if the cap is set too high  it will be meaningless  if it set too low  it will damage our economy  at best it is a gesture  at worst it is a deceit  the home secretary knows that a cut in her department s budget of one third  according to the institute for fiscal studies 25   according to her right hon  friend the chancellor will have disastrous consequences for border control  is that not the real reason for controlling immigration  rather than this artificial and unnecessary tinkering at the edges 
i am grateful to the home secretary for early sight of the statement  the fifth anniversary of 7 7 yesterday reminded us all of the threat to this country and the tremendous work of the security services and the police in protecting our citizens from harm  the prime minister pointed out on tuesday very eloquently  i thought how real those threats continue to be the home secretary will be aware that the european court s judgment was based on the way that section 44 powers were used by the metropolitan police some years ago  and that the previous government  together with the police authorities  reviewed and improved their procedures in the intervening period  will she confirm that the number of stop and searches under section 44 has reduced considerably over the last two years  she will also be aware that all the uk courts  including the high court and the house of lords  rejected the argument that the gillan and quinton case represented a breach of article 8  in particular  the law lords were doubtful whether an ordinary  superficial search of the person could be said to show a lack of respect for private life  even if article 8 did apply  they said the procedure was used in accordance with the law and it was impossible to regard a proper exercise of the power as other than proportionate when seeking to counter the great danger of terrorism the home secretary will also be aware that the select committee on home affairs examined this issue thoroughly in 2005  when the current prime minister was a member of that committee  and rejected the allegation that the asian community was being unreasonably targeted by the metropolitan police in its use of section 44 powers  she will also know that while the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation  lord carlile  had concerns that section 44 powers were being used too often this was before the changes in 2007 08 he stated clearly that the power remains necessary and proportional to the continuing and serious risk of terrorism  given all those facts  i am amazed that the home secretary would not have pursued an appeal  given that every court in this country rejected the argument in respect of gillan and quinton nevertheless  we are where we are in terms of the legal avenues in europe  and it does seem to me sensible to change the test for authorisation from  expedience  to  necessity  and to use a test of  reasonable suspicion   but i am deeply concerned about the home secretary s intention to restrict section 44 powers to searches of vehicles  that quite clearly restricts the powers of the police was the police service of northern ireland consulted  given the current dissident threat in northern ireland  we sometimes say that there have been no terrorist murders in britain this year  but there have been in the united kingdom  there have been terrorist murders in northern ireland  what is the view of the association of chief police officers  and in particular the metropolitan police commissioner  on this restriction  were they consulted  was lord carlile consulted  and if so  what is his view does the home secretary accept that section 43 does not require ministerial authority  and why does she believe it is necessary to go this far  by restricting section 44 to searches of vehicles only  in responding to the european court s judgment  is she saying that nothing less will suffice  did she explore other legislative options  and will she publish for consultation other options for amending section 44  so that the house can see the alternatives and debate them fully we have the prospect in this country of the police being asked to continue to protect us with fewer officers  diminished resources and restricted powers  the home secretary needs to understand that it is not the coalition agreement that will keep the public safe it is the security services and the police  the statement today will undoubtedly make their job more difficult 
i am grateful to the home secretary for giving me early sight of her statement  it is important to recall that when the terrorism bill received its third reading in november 2005  it had all party support  so both parties to the coalition government supported the bulk of the legislation that will now be reviewed  two things characterised that debate  which came a few months after the horror and carnage of 7 7  the first was the realisation that no change in government policy would remove the uk from al qaeda s firing line and that the only response to the threat was to contest and then defeat it  the second was the extraordinary lengths that were taken to proceed on the basis of consensus  not just with the then shadow home secretary  the right hon  member for haltemprice and howden  mr davis   and the lib dem spokesman mark oaten  but with the select committee on home affairs and the joint committee on human rights the threat that was faced then has not diminished  the prime minister put it succinctly in his statement of 6 july  when he said  as we meet in the relative safety of this house today  let us not forget this  as we speak  al qaeda operatives in yemen are meeting in secret to plot attacks against us  terrorists are preparing to attack our forces in afghanistan  the real ira is planning its next strike against security forces in northern ireland  and rogue regimes are still trying to acquire nuclear weapons      official report  6 july 2010  vol  513  c  178  can the home secretary confirm that the review is not being held to scale down the powers needed to address a diminishing threat  but is far from that  what is the latest estimate of the number of terror suspects actively engaged in complex plots and can she tell us how many such plots have been disrupted since 7 7 the review must surely be held in the context of how those powers are working on the ground  in that context  will she provide information  if necessary on privy council terms  as charles clarke did in 2005  to allow her majesty s opposition to be fully conversant with the backdrop to this review  will she ensure that the same spirit of consensus seeking takes place in reviewing anti terrorism legislation that characterised the approach to the terrorism act 2006 the home secretary s statement contained the immature and partisan attacks on the previous government that are becoming rather tiresome and that are unworthy of a debate of this seriousness  will she tell me in what way she considers the previous government to have ridden roughshod over civil liberties on control orders  deportation with assurances  dealing with organisations that promote hatred or violence  or on the detention of terrorist suspects before charge on the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000  and in relation to some of the most widely spread myths about ripa  is she aware that the interception of communications commissioner  sir paul kennedy  concluded his latest annual report by saying that no evidence has emerged from the inspections which have been conducted during the last three years to indicate communications data is being used to investigate offences of a trivial nature  such as dog fouling or littering  what are the terms of reference for the review  they are not in the statement  is it to be held purely in the context of civil liberties  or will it have a wider remit  we believe that it should  does the home secretary think the time scale long enough to do justice to the issues under review  given the fact that the olympics are fast approaching  will they be a factor in the deliberations given our joint desire to overcome the practical difficulties that prevent the use of intercept as evidence in our courts  given that 28 day detention has to be reapproved by parliament each year and given that control orders are subject to annual report by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation  what further safeguards does the home secretary believe may be necessary  i would on this occasion appreciate some answers  given the importance of the subject i worry about the government s position on counter terrorism  they admonish senior counter terrorism police officers for daring to discuss in a closed meeting with colleagues the implication of a 25  cut in their funding  they refuse to give the police and the security services the same assurances on funding as they provide for the department for international development  they plan to diminish important weapons in the fight against crime and terrorism such as the dna database and cctv  the balance between collective security and individual freedom has to be carefully struck under the ever changing and constantly evolving threat of international terrorism  but this review appears to be about one side of that balance liberal democrats should remember the words of john stuart mill  who said  all that makes existence valuable to anyone depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people  the government should remember that the slow creep of complacency is a phrase often used to describe the erosion of civil liberties  it is equally applicable to our vulnerability to terrorist attack 
it seems that the home secretary and i are allies in the debate this afternoon although  having read her written ministerial statement and listened to her speech  i think that she is adopting the position of st augustine  lord  make us virtuous  but not yet   the home secretary and i have many things in common  among them our charm  panache  looks and preference for flat shoes  and we both voted for 28 days in 2005  neither of us has ever voted against 28 days  and we both belong to political parties that made no mention of reducing pre charge detention of terrorist suspects in our manifestos this issue will  of course  form part of the review that the home secretary rather foolishly described yesterday as putting right the failures of the previous government  if 28 days was a failure  it is strange that she should advocate the continuation of that failure today  she is right to do so  as so often with the home secretary  the problem is not so much what she does as the way in which she does it  she told us yesterday that personally she was always in favour of 14 days  we understand that it is impossible to tell what she believes from her voting record  but this fervour for 14 days has been a well kept secret  she has always actually voted for 28 days incidentally  the person whom the home secretary has appointed to provide independent oversight of the review the former director of public prosecutions  lord macdonald of river glaven made clear in evidence to the home affairs committee his support for 28 days  stating  we welcomed the increase to 28 days and we felt that a period of 14 days was not sufficient  it seems to us that 28 days has been effective and has provided us with powers  supervised by the courts  which have been useful to us as prosecutors in making appropriate charging decisions within that period  this review  like brighton seafront  has two peers both lib dems and the views of lord macdonald are completely in line with the view of lord carlile  the independent reviewer of the terrorist legislation  whose work the home secretary rightly described yesterday as  excellent   lord carlile not only accepted the need to maintain 28 days but said  i expect in the course of time to see cases in which the current maximum of 28 days will be proved inadequate  this will be very rare but inevitably extremely serious  the 28 day pre charge detention for terrorist suspects is a temporary measure which  thanks to the work of my hon  friend the member for walsall north  mr winnick   who is in his place  has to be renewed each year  the task of the house in considering whether to support a further extension in this case for six months was succinctly expressed by the hon  member for bury st edmunds  mr ruffley when he spoke for the conservatives in last year s debate  perhaps i may just mention that we all look forward to seeing the hon  gentleman restored to good health  he has many friends across the house who respect and admire him and want to see him back on the government benches very quickly  he said last year that the government must first demonstrate convincingly to parliament that the security situation is such that 28 days remains indispensable  and secondly  that the legal framework must meet the procedural protections afforded by our common law and by the human rights act  he said  with his customary prescience  i hope this will give an indication of the approach that we want to take  should there be a change of government before the next renewal  i accept that a small minority of members it may or may not include the home secretary are convinced that pre charge detention should be 14 days or less  and i respect that view  it has been consistently argued by several a minority  but several members  the majority of members  however  will look at the evidence and decide on that basis whether in the year since we last renewed this legislation  the terrorist threat has faded and or whether this legislation is being abused by the criminal justice system 
i am not aware of that  in fact  the usual argument is that the common law countries such as australia  canada and even the us do not have this system  europe is the worst place for my hon  friend to find his examples  let me cite norway  for instance  good old  solid  scandinavian  liberal norway has provisions that allow people to be kept in custody renewed by a high court judge  who is involved in any detention beyond 14 days for far longer than 28 days  or even 42 days  that was a helpful intervention  and i am grateful to my hon  friend i think that the hon  member for bury st edmunds succinctly summed up the two issues i mentioned  but there is one further aspect that we have to consider in deciding whether to renew this legislation  it was rightly raised by my right hon  friend the member for leicester east  keith vaz   the issue is whether the very existence of 28 day detention leads to radicalisation in certain communities to the extent that it defeats the objective of reducing the terrorist threat  the home office community impact study published in march certainly found examples of uk muslims having a strong negative perception of counter terrorism legislation  but concluded that there was insufficient evidence on specific aspects  such as 28 days  to lead to any firm conclusions  i doubt whether anyone in this chamber thinks that pre charge detention of 28 rather than 14 days has of itself radicalised anyone to the extent that they would be prepared to engage in terrorist activity while i am dealing with this aspect  i hope the home secretary can refute the story in  the guardian this morning that she has decided to dismantle the prevent strategy  she told my right hon  friend the member for salford and eccles  hazel blears yesterday  as is recorded in column 802 of  hansard  that the strategy was being reviewed between the home department and the department for communities and local government  when i read the home office draft structural reform plan released yesterday  which is the source of the story in  the guardian  all i could find was the eminently sensible objective of keeping the  prevent  strand of counter terrorism separate from the  integration  initiatives of dclg  i would welcome clarification 
i am grateful for that clarification  and i completely agree with what the home secretary has said about prevent as the home secretary said in her speech  the security threat is  if anything  greater today than it was a year ago  in the year since the last renewal  we have learned more  by means of operation overt  about the so called liquid bomb plot  through the successful prosecution of those involved  we should remember that this involved the planned destruction of seven passenger planes all flying to north america  and is one case in which pre charge detention beyond 14 days was necessary in respect of six people involved in that plot we also know now that operation pathway in greater manchester  which was a matter of speculation in the debate this time last year  is now understood to have been a serious and advanced terrorist plot  it was  thankfully  thwarted yet again by the security services  in the past year  two further organisations have been proscribed  the threat level  decided not by ministers but by the experts in the security agencies  has been changed to  substantial  and then back to the second highest level   severe   which means that an attack is highly likely  as we meet today to make a decision based on the evidence over the coming year  that is the position in which we find ourselves on christmas day  umar farouk abdulmutallab  a nigerian citizen who studied in the united kingdom and was radicalised in yemen  flew from lagos via holland with 80 grams of petn explosive which successfully circumvented aviation security sewn into his underpants  in an attempt to blow up a passenger plane over detroit  that demonstrated first the continuing ingenuity of our enemies  and secondly the international nature of the threat there has been one other important development over the year  the report of the all party group of privy counsellors  under the chairmanship of sir john chilcot  on the crucial issue of intercept evidence  when i was home secretary  i briefed the prime minister and the deputy prime minister separately in their previous roles  they fully understand as  i know  does the home secretary that the privy counsellors found that two of the nine principles that they themselves had established in order to ensure a practical way in which to meet our shared desire to use intercept as evidence were breached during the simulations that they conducted in their course of their work  they are doing further work to see whether they can find a way around the difficulties  but the issue is obviously integral to the whole question of pre charge detention i ask the home secretary to reconsider the response that she gave yesterday to the hon  member for wellingborough  mr bone   who asked why intercept evidence was not being considered as part of the review  she rightly said that it was better to consider the issue over time  but that  i believe  is an argument for spending longer on the review  i fail to see how such an important component of the argument about 28 days rehearsed in every annual debate  and also integral to the consideration of control orders  which is also part of the review can be separated from the overall review finally  there is the important question of whether the power is being abused in the legal framework  some members argue that we should abandon this measure because it is not used very often  but i would be more concerned if it were used other than sparingly  as the home secretary rightly said  it is an exceptional measure  as lord carlile has pointed out  the need for it is rare  and the crown prosecution service is well aware that no one should be detained for a moment longer than necessary  there is no evidence that the power has been abused  but lord carlile made an important recommendation in his review of operation pathway  proposing the granting of conditional bail by a judge for a period up to the 28th day following arrest  which would enable restrictions short of custody to be imposed while the inquiry continued  that strikes me as worthy of consideration  perhaps during the review in my view  the evidence is overwhelming  the statutory instrument should be approved today  and the government should tread very carefully if the purpose of their review is to arrive at a conclusion consistent with the liberal democrat manifesto commitment to reduce the 28 day pre charge detention period for terrorist suspects regardless of the dangers and the overwhelming evidence 
the right hon  gentleman is making a very effective case  can he explain why  in last year s debate on this issue  he voted for the continuation of 28 days  his party abstained but he made the point in that debate that he could not accept 14 days  which he is now advocating  precisely because he knew inside details of operation overt and what happened at heathrow  what changed his mind during the ensuing year 
the statement should be entitled   policing in the 21st century  how to make the job harder   as usual  the home secretary trots out her infantile drivel about the last labour government  probably written by some pimply nerd foisted on her office by no  10 the home secretary said that she aims to undo the damage of the labour years  that damage was recorded in the home office s statistics on 15 july  here it is  overall crime is down by 50   violent crime is down by 50   property crime is down by 55   the murder rate is at its lowest level since at any time over the past 20 years  and the chance of being a victim of crime is at its lowest level since records began in 1981 21 5   down from its peak of 40  under the conservatives  that is the damage that she is seeking to undo the kind of damage that any government would be proud of the home secretary is about to have her budget cut by at least 25  
thanks to us  the hon  lady says from a sedentary position  i remind her that we were making the police a priority and guaranteeing the funding for record numbers of police officers last week s report by her majesty s inspectorate of constabulary and the audit commission made it plain that any cuts above 12  were bound adversely to affect front line policing  soon we will learn how the government plan to restrict the use of the dna database and cctv  and thus make it harder for the police to catch criminals  today we have the final part of the triple whammy structural upheaval through the imposition of elected commissioners and the abolition of the serious organised crime agency  perhaps the home secretary can tell me which chief constables  which police authority chairs or even which local authority leaders support the replacement of police authorities by a single elected commissioner  sir simon milton  when he was the conservative head of the local government association  said  there are already people elected at local level to represent the community and be advocates over a range of services they re called councillors  is not the home secretary setting up  in sir simon milton s words  a parallel and potentially conflicting system with a competing mandate  sir hugh orde has said  every professional bone in my body tells me that having elected commissioners is a bad idea that could drive a coach and horses through the current model of accountability and add nothing but confusion  the conservative chair of the association of police authorities has said that the idea appears to be driven by dogma  and richard kemp  the leader of the liberal democrat group on the local government association  has said that the vast majority of the 3 700 lib dem councillors a figure soon to be drastically reduced at the next election oppose an elected commissioner  does the home secretary not think that the narrower the remit of the position  the weaker the case for having the occupier of that position decided by ballot how will the home secretary safeguard the operational independence of the chief constable  as the apa has pointed out  police authorities have done a great deal over the past few years to ensure that the public understand their role and that police authority members are properly equipped and trained to operate effectively  there is a clear argument for enhancing and increasing the role and responsibility of local government  so that local councillors have a clear mandate for holding the police to account  that is the route that we should be taking  rather than this unnecessary  unwanted and expensive diversion  can the home secretary tell me whether the lga is right when it states that the elected commissioners will cost £50 million  what is her estimate the coalition agreement talked about refocusing the serious organised crime agency  not eliminating it  that organisation was formed only four years ago  and the structural upheaval then took years to settle down 
it was our structural upheaval  i agree completely  but that is what occurs with any reorganisation  to put people through another structural upheaval four years later is simply madness in 2006  soca was wrongly described as replicating the fbi  and reports over the weekend gave the same description  does the home secretary think it is accurate  she will be aware of sir paul stephenson s john harris memorial lecture recently  which rejected the fbi option  sir paul set out a model built upon soca  not upon replacing it  and his national federated model has much to commend it  why is the home secretary not pursuing that alternative the child exploitation and online protection centre does fantastic work  to build upon that work  we were moving it away from soca to be a non departmental public body  will the home secretary continue that process  and if not  why not will the dedicated border force replace the uk border agency  and how many jobs will be lost as a result of these initiatives in soca  the ukba  the national policing improvement agency and elsewhere we have yet to hear a word from this government about how they plan to cut crime  all we have heard is how they will cut officer numbers  prison places and police powers  today  the home secretary has managed to reannounce at least three decisions that we had already taken in government  she says that she will mandate beat meetings to challenge the performance of neighbourhood policing teams  having scrapped the policing pledge drawn up by chief constables themselves to provide exactly that mandate the home secretary inherited the department when crime had fallen substantially  public confidence in the police had never been higher and public concern about antisocial behaviour had never been lower  she says she is pursuing bold policies  in fact she is pursuing bad policies  i was pleased to see the government s u turn on anonymity for rape defendants  elected commissioners need to go the same way 
i do not want to worry the right hon  lady unduly at our daily meeting  but i broadly welcome this statement  i suspect that i am just a short preliminary to the real opposition on the matter  which is the brokeback tendency behind her    hon  members   bareback    or bareback tendency  even  which adds a whole new dimension we supported the stockholm programme in december  which included the decision that a comprehensive system for obtaining evidence in cases with a cross border dimension  based on the principle of mutual recognition  should be further pursued  not least because as the home secretary said  the current framework consists of a whole series of instruments that are fragmentary and repetitive  they hamper cross border investigation at a time when the international dimension  particularly of serious organised crime  is of increasing importance there is a clear need for a comprehensive  legally binding single instrument to provide a definitive framework for cross border investigations  that should not be conflated with the european prosecutor proposal  which we were firmly against  perhaps the home secretary can confirm that failure to opt into the current instrument would leave the uk with the existing unsatisfactory and fragmentary provision  thus putting us at a disadvantage in the fight against cross border crime  in contrast  as she said  opting in will allow us to negotiate further safeguards  does she agree that those should include greater consideration of the rights of the suspect  and should not that include judicial scrutiny at both the issuing and executing stage i agree with the home secretary that there should be a proportionality test  as with the european evidence warrant  which i believe the uk will no longer be obliged to implement if we sign up to the eio  can she confirm that that is the case the human rights organisation  justice  has indeed urged the government to opt into the instrument  but it has raised a number of concerns about the initial draft  what discussions have the secretary of state or her ministers had with that organisation  and does she agree with its analysis it is good to see that the government have recognised that cross border crime is a serious concern  the home secretary s party opposed the european arrest warrant  principally  i believe  because it contained the word  european   i am glad that she is not repeating that mistake  and in welcoming her statement  i hope that will rethink her approach on second generation biometric passports so that as with the eio  british citizens are not left behind as security measures in the rest of the european union become more effective 
if the conservative party believes so fervently in direct accountability  why is the unelected deputy mayor chairing the london metropolitan police authority 
yes  well  it is not very reassuring that the most prominent  high profile conservative mayor the minister and i agree that the mayor should take responsibility for the police steps down and allows his unelected deputy to chair the metropolitan police authority  that person  kit malthouse  says that chief constables are  mini governors  who  control a standing army   does the minister agree with that  does he think it right that the deputy mayor of london should chair the metropolitan police authority when he says that elected commissioners would be able to  wield the rod  over chief constables  is that the purpose of the reforms 
mr justice gross said in the case of mulcaire and goodman that it was not about press freedom  but about a grave  inexcusable and illegal invasion of privacy  last year  i was assured that the metropolitan police service had not received any allegations in respect of other  news of the world journalists  i was also told that the metropolitan police had taken all proper steps to ensure that where there was evidence of phone tapping  or any suspicion of it  the individuals concerned would be informed the home secretary will be aware of the claims by  the new york times to have spoken to over a dozen former  news of the world reporters  and to at least one of its former editors  who say that phone tapping was pervasive  furthermore the hon  member for maldon  mr whittingdale   a very distinguished chair of the culture  media and sport committee  said  there was simply no enthusiasm among scotland yard to go beyond the cases involving mulcaire and goodman  to start exposing widespread tawdry practices in that newsroom was a heavy stone that they didn t want to try to lift  does the home secretary agree that this stone has to be lifted  and that she must subject the actions of the metropolitan police in this case to greater scrutiny in the light of this allegation and the new revelations from  the new york times  the original investigation  we are told  uncovered 2 978 mobile phone numbers of potential victims and 91 pin codes  can the right hon  lady ascertain how many of the people concerned have now been informed when i was home secretary dealing with this case  there was nobody anywhere in government who was implicated  now there is  the home secretary and the deputy prime minister have lectured the house many times about their perception of the surveillance state created by the previous government  it appears that they may have their very own expert on the matter in charge of government communications  can she assure me that andy coulson will not be involved in any way in the government s response to the latest allegations  does she agree with her right hon  friend the secretary of state for energy and climate change  who told parliament last year that it is extraordinary that the leader of the opposition  who wants to be a prime minister  employs andy coulson who  at best  was responsible for a newspaper that was out of control and  at worst  was personally implicated in criminal activity   the exact parallel  said the right hon  member for eastleigh  chris huhne   is surely with damian mcbride  if the prime minister was right to sack him  should not the leader of the opposition sack andy coulson      official report  9 july 2009  vol  495  c  1132  i agree with those sentiments expressed by the right hon  lady s cabinet colleague does she 
i beg to move that this house notes with concern the government s failure to prioritise the safety of communities by not protecting central government funding for the police  notes the conclusion of the audit commission and hm inspectorate of constabulary that any budget reduction over 12 per cent  will reduce frontline policing  pays tribute to the police and other agencies for achieving a 43 per cent  reduction in crime  including a 42 per cent  cut in violent crime  since 1997  and for maintaining that reduction through last year s recession  notes that public perception of anti social behaviour is at its lowest level since it was recorded in the british crime survey of 2001 02  further notes that the previous government set out plans in its policing white paper to drive down policing costs whilst maintaining core funding  and condemns the government s policy of reducing police numbers  restricting police powers and imposing elected commissioners to replace police authorities  thus condemning the police service to unnecessary  unwelcome and costly re structuring at a time when their focus should be on maintaining the fall in crime and anti social behaviour the previous government were the first since the end of world war one to leave office with a lower level of crime and disorder than when they came into power  in a previous debate when i mentioned that fact  the home secretary challenged it by rather bizarrely mentioning michael howard now the noble lord howard of lympne who may have been many things  but was not a government  although it is true that the noble lord howard recently much derided by his former colleagues was the only conservative home secretary in 18 years to preside over any reduction in crime at all  it was a modest reduction  to 4 6 million crimes a year  compared with 2 3 million in 1979  when the conservatives were elected  in other words  without lord howard s contribution  crime under the tories would have more than doubled  thanks to him  it merely doubled  with violent crime rising by 168  and robbery by 405  the conservative party that presided over that truly miserable record refuses to acknowledge the tremendous work of the police and other agencies in tackling its legacy  the conservatives can no longer deny that crime has fallen  including violent crime  so they resort to saying that crime is still too high and they are right  it is  but when they were in power  the chances of being a victim of crime were 40   now it is 21 5   the lowest since records began  the latest statistics  published by the new government in july and covering 2009 10  confirm the trend  both recorded and surveyed crime continued to fall  by around 9   through the deepest global recession in the post war era  thus effectively destroying the theory of lord howard s fiercest critic  and probably his most feeble predecessor  the current justice secretary  that crime fell under labour only because the economy improved the purpose of today s debate is to set out why that record of success is being jeopardised and to highlight three specific areas  first  the home secretary s failure to stand up to the treasury and insist that policing and counter terrorism be prioritised in the comprehensive spending review  secondly  her determination to restrict the ability of the police and other agencies to use dna  cctv and  now we discover  antisocial behaviour orders to deter and catch miscreants  and thirdly  the dogmatic pursuit of the abolition of police authorities and their replacement by a single elected commissioner in respect of the csr  we know that some secretaries of state are arguing vociferously for their departments  but the one with the best argument is apparently content to take a 25  to 40  cut in her budget  before government members seek to intervene on me with their chief whip crib sheets subtitled  patrick mcloughlin s route to a ministerial career  let me say that if labour had won the general election  the home office budget would have been cut and the police would have had to make savings  that is not a matter for conjecture  £1 3 billion of savings that we would have implemented by 2013 are itemised in last year s pre budget report  the budget  last november s policing white paper and other public documents 
i knew that that one would be on the crib sheet  of course it was right to say honestly to the public that no home secretary could guarantee that police numbers would not fall by a single police officer  the number of police and recruitment for the police are matters for chief constables and police authorities  what we guaranteed  as i will explain in a second  was that the central funding that the home office provides which has led to the recruitment of 17 000 more police officers and 16 000 police community support officers would continue to be provided  index linked  because we considered crime and policing to be a priority the savings that we set out included £70 million in reduced police overtime  £75 million from business support and back office functions  £400 million from procurement and it  and £500 million from process improvement  my deal with the previous chancellor the one who did produce progressive budgets was to prioritise the police and security services by maintaining the 2010 level of central funding necessary for the continued employment of record police numbers  thus reducing the home office budget by around 12  or £1 3 billion without hitting front line policing we have had a report from her majesty s inspectorate of constabulary and the audit commission endorsing that approach  the report   policing in an age of austerity   concluded that cost cutting and improvements in productivity could  if relentlessly pursued  generate a saving of 12  in central government funding    while maintaining police availability  this is therefore not an argument about whether there need to be cuts to the police budget over the next four years  it is an argument about a cut of 12  or  as the chancellor announced on 22 june  a cut of 25  for the home office  which he describes as an unprotected department 
i thank my right hon  friend for that question  i do not think that the collegiate approach in this house has stretched as far as members on the opposition benches getting the government chief whip s crib sheet  i know that that was his own question  although i suppose that it might have come from our crib sheet  the issue is this  we would not have revealed before a csr what the settlement was  that is why it is difficult to itemise the savings in advance of a csr  what can be done and what we did with the police in the policing white paper is to identify those areas that i have mentioned and ensure that the police and the security services understand that we were prioritising police and security  also  in this year parliament  including those now on the government benches  approved the allocation of funding  knowing that there would be another pay increase in the three year police pay deal  what has happened now is that the government have not only demanded more savings this year  despite having to meet that pay increase  but frozen the precept  the police are in a far worse position  including the chief constable of kent  than they would have been had we been in government it is extraordinary that the government should refuse to add policing to health  education and international development as an area requiring special consideration  the chancellor is fond of quoting canada as a precedent for the kind of savage cuts that he heralded in the emergency budget  but the canadian government were not foolish enough to slash police budgets  expenditure on policing fell by just 0 1  in the years following the canadian star chamber cuts  and then rose steadily thereafter  the number of police officers dipped by at most 3   in this country  the budget will be slashed by at least 25   which means a cut in police numbers of between 35 000  as estimated by professor talbot  the respected criminologist at manchester university  and 60 000  according to the magazine jane s police review  which took what i hope is the exaggerated view that the cuts might amount to 40  the hmic report means that there can be no further pretence that front line policing can somehow emerge unscathed from this kind of budgetary carnage  as well as failing to protect central allocations  on which police forces rely for between 50  and 90  of their funding  the government have placed a two year moratorium on any increases in the local precepts  so much for localism  as a result  plans are already being drawn up in every police force throughout the country to cut the number of officers  as my right hon  friend has pointed out  the 16 000 police community support officers  who are popular with the public and central to neighbourhood policing  are bound to go if there are cuts of 25   as civilian staff  they are more easy to dispose of  which is why police forces such as durham have already put every pcso under notice of redundancy there was nothing about this in the coalition partners  manifestos  indeed  the lib dems  who believed that this country was under policed  were promising to use the money saved by scrapping identity cards to recruit 3 000 additional police officers  we now have the government s own figures for the amount of money that will be saved by scrapping id cards  i will willingly take an intervention from anyone on the lib dem benches if they want to tell me how many police officers that equates to  is it 3 000  no  is it 2 500  2 000  1 000  500  200  no  if we used all the money saved by scrapping id cards  we would get 117 extra officers  not 3 000  would that we could look forward to any increase in officer numbers at all  it is now likely that the lib dems will preside over the loss of 3 000 officers every four months over the next four years 
my hon  friend makes an interesting point  during the general election  the conservatives and labour were united in saying   don t let the lib dems anywhere near crime or national security or immigration  for that matter   we remember some of their policies in that area  i do not blame the lib dems at all for the government s policy on crime and policing  the home secretary has been careful to have only one lib dem in her team  and she is a very good minister  but the government have not allowed her anywhere near the important stuff in the home office  this policy cannot be described as a coalition approach  certainly  the decision not to prioritise the police in the comprehensive spending review was made by the conservatives i have mentioned the likely loss of police officers over the next four years  let us have no doubt that cuts of this magnitude will also put national security at risk  as the most senior counter terrorism officer in the uk has made clear  insufficient resources will inevitably lead to the closure of regional counter terrorism units  to fewer surveillance teams to monitor suspects  and to a reduction in the number of police officers who work full time on counter terrorism 
that is certainly an issue  particularly in the light of the hmic audit commission s joint report  we must take a rigorous approach to its conclusion that  if the government cut more than 12   front line policing will be affected  perhaps this is one of the reasons why the audit commission has been done away with  i hope that hmic will not come next as police numbers reduce  so will their powers  i shall deal with dna and cctv in a moment 
when we were in government  we decided to pick the priority departments  and the chosen areas were health  education  international development and crime and policing  it is extraordinary that the present government     interruption    hang on  i am answering the question  it is incredible that the present government believe that international development  health and  to a certain extent  education must be prioritised  and that they are more important than crime and policing  quite frankly  i can say as a former health secretary that we did not commit to increase the health budget above the rate of inflation  that budget was £110 billion  i went from the department of health  which had a £110 billion budget  to the home office  which had a budget of about £10 billion  we would have saved £73 billion  we would not have gone for a saving of £113 billion  which boris johnson described only yesterday as cutting too savagely and too deeply  it is a central feature of this argument that the government are going too far with the cuts and that they are failing to treat crime and policing as a priority in the comprehensive spending review  even though it is a priority for constituents everywhere during the summer  the home secretary made a speech saying that we needed to  move beyond the asbo   i want to make two things clear  first  the antisocial behaviour order is the most serious of a range of civil powers introduced in 1998 so that the police  local authorities and other agencies could tackle the problem in a co ordinated way  they needed to tackle the kind of behaviour that falls short of criminality but nevertheless destroys people s lives  these powers are not driven from whitehall  as the home secretary suggested  but through community safety partnerships that involve community groups and social enterprises the second thing that we need to be clear about is that  where those powers are used effectively  they work  i shall lapse into what i hope is uncharacteristic immodesty for a moment when i say that they worked particularly well during my year as home secretary  when an additional emphasis was placed on the victim and on intensified activity in localities where public perception of antisocial behaviour was above average the social affairs correspondent of  the guardian said recently that these measures had had no discernible effect  but they had a discernible effect in the one place where an effect can be discerned namely  the british crime survey  the home office  under the current home secretary  stated on 15 july that  whereas previous reductions had been in one or two specific areas  the reduction between 08 09 and 09 10  the glorious year of johnson  reflects falls in the proportion of people perceiving a problem with almost all types of anti social behaviour that make up the overall measure  that refers to reductions in abandoned cars  noisy neighbours  drunkenness  drug use  youth nuisance  litter  vandalism and graffiti  those are all issues for which there were insufficient powers prior to the crime and disorder act 1998  the statistical release went on to say that antisocial behaviour was now at its lowest level since records began  with  for the first time  a majority of the population agreeing that the police and councils were dealing with antisocial behaviour in their local area 
it is great to hear conservative members accepting that crime has fallen  as they spent so long dancing around the issue under the right hon  member for epsom and ewell  chris grayling   they were told off by the uk statistics authorities and by everyone who looked at the matter  some people in the police force are looking askance at what this government are doing  i mentioned the record under the previous conservative government  the hon  member for tamworth  christopher pincher  is right that the conviction rate needs to be tackled as well  but under the previous conservative government  it was not just the conviction rate and the detection rate that had not been tackled  as crime reached 4 6 million a doubling under the tories  there was a 168  increase in violent crime and a 405  increase in burglary  of course  the labour government can be criticised for aspects of what happened over the last 13 years  but what no conservative member can do is to suggest that somehow crime has gone up when that was in fact their legacy  if britain were ever broken  it was broken between 1979 and 1997  the statistics i am citing are not mine  they are the home secretary s the death of fiona pilkington and her daughter last year shocked this house and shocked the country  it had a profound impact on me as the incoming home secretary  that is why i wanted to intensify action  there is no evidence from this tragic incident that it is time to move beyond the asbo  all the evidence  summarised so astutely by the coroner in that tragic case  showed that the police and local authority in leicestershire were acting as if they lived in the pre asbo era  when no powers existed  one police officer said at the inquest that antisocial behaviour was nothing to do with the police  he was wrong  it is certainly not the responsibility of the police alone  but the police are responsible for it  that police officer was wrong  but 13 years ago  he would have been right  we have to be careful not to return to those days  the home secretary speaks of the need to tackle the root causes of this kind of behaviour as if she is unaware of sure start  free nursery education  family nurse partnerships  family intervention projects  the education maintenance allowance  the huge increase in apprenticeships  the 30  increase in the number of kids from deprived areas going to university and all the other measures introduced by the labour government yes  to be tough on the causes of crime  as well as on crime itself 
i am grateful to my right hon  friend  who did a great deal during her time at the home office to pursue this agenda  i think that all social strata can suffer from this problem  but she is right in what she says about poor areas  that is why we must never go back to the days when the typical response to this problem on the labour benches was saying that we should not get involved in it  we did  we have  it succeeded  we pioneered restorative justice  we began linking drug treatment to prison sentences  we trebled investment in prison education  as a result  reoffending is down by 20  and youth reoffending by nearly 25  the home secretary said in her july speech that for 13 years people had been told that the asbo was the silver bullet that would cure society s ills  i want her to give me one example just one of a minister ever making any such claim  we never did  it took a whole range of measures to deal with the spiralling crime that we inherited  and that is what we did  as usual  the only thing wrong with the home secretary s pronouncements is the facts 
there it is  this is another  big society  argument or  do it yourself   there will not be any pcsos and police numbers will be cut  so do it yourself  actually  that article did not in any way contradict what i am saying  there is not one police officer or local government officer in this country and no one on a crime and disorder reduction partnership who does not understand that people have to work together using a range of measures  including getting communities involved  it works successfully where communities have decided to turn their own communities around  but they get help  what the government are now proposing the hon  member for oxford west and abingdon  nicola blackwood  could not have put it more succinctly is that people will get no help in future  that is the tory argument that we are countering  as i said before  the home secretary is often accurate on everything except for the facts 
yes  i agree  as i mentioned  asbos are the most serious of the range of measures to combat antisocial behaviour  as an acceptable behaviour contract or a simple letter to the parents of a miscreant might be enough to stop it  what we introduced  as the coroner in the fiona pilkington case pointed out  was 15 measures that the police and local authorities could use  dependent on severity of the behaviour  asbos  as i say  apply at the more severe end  but all those measures need to be used together  depending on the problem 
no  not again  if my hon  friend does not mind  i have already given way once to him on dna  the home secretary says with the smug piety that can have come only from working closely with the liberal democrats that our proposed way forward on the dna database was disgraceful  because  she says with eyes blazing  it meant that the dna of innocent people would be retained  that is what the right hon  lady says and i see her nodding her head  it is a viewpoint that she uses against us  the fact is  however  that she proposes to do exactly the same  the difference is that we would keep the dna profiles of those innocent of both serious and non serious offences while she would keep the former but not the latter  furthermore  we would both take the dna from all those arrested and keep it for a sufficient period to check against previous crime scenes  the logic of the lofty argument that she has got from the lib dems    interruption   i will come on to the issue of six years in a few moments  the logic of the argument that innocent people s dna is being kept is that we should not take dna from anyone until they are convicted  let me explain how nutty that proposition is  it is so nutty that it is not even a lib dem conference policy always a good gauge of whether something is extraordinarily daft there is no evidence whatever that those arrested but not convicted of a non serious offence have any lower propensity to be re arrested than those arrested but not convicted of serious offences  i repeat no evidence whatever  if there is  we will no doubt hear it put forward from the government dispatch box  mark dixie  the man who brutally raped and murdered sally anne bowman in her front garden  was on the dna database because he had been arrested but not convicted of a pub fight a non serious offence  if that dna link had not been made  a guilty man would have remained free to rape and murder again and an innocent man  sally anne s boyfriend  who had dropped her off outside her home after a blazing row witnessed by passers by  would probably be serving a life sentence  steve wright  the murderer of five prostitutes in ipswich  was on the dna database because he had been arrested for suspected theft  he would not have been on the database under the scottish model  which this government want to adopt furthermore  while the scottish model retains the dna of those arrested but not charged for three years i come to the issue raised by a sedentary comment from the minister for immigration rather than for six years as we propose  it also allows the police to extend the period of retention for unlimited further two year periods  the next time members hear the home secretary accuse labour of wanting to retain the dna of innocent people for six years  they should remind themselves that she wants to adopt the scottish model  she wants to adopt a system that allows the dna of innocent people to be retained indefinitely  a system that has no evidential support  a system that  according to the association of chief police officers  would cost an additional £158 million to administer because of all the bureaucracy involved in the two year reviews  and most important a system that would have probably left 26 murderers and rapists unconvicted had it been in force last year 
the minister is in the home office now  he can seek the evidence  it comes from acpo s research  and it comes from home office statistics  that is why i used it when i was home secretary  that is why my right hon  friend the member for delyn  mr hanson  and i used it when we steered through legislation that was agreed to by the minister s colleagues     interruption   during the wash up period  the right hon  member for epsom and ewell  chris grayling  said   no way will we agree to this   but they agreed to it  they could have stopped it  but they did not  i hope that that is because they have begun to realise their sheer folly and i assure them that they will discover what folly there is in the actions proposed by the government as for cctv  we still do not know what the coalition means by its reference to greater regulation  or why it considers that there is a problem  i can tell my hon  friend the member for chesterfield  toby perkins  that that reference definitely came from the liberal democrats  but we do not know what it means  given the existence of the data protection act  the human rights act and the freedom of information act  all of which apply to the authorities responsible for public space cctv surveillance  it is difficult to gauge the problem  but in the light of the portentous speeches of the deputy prime minister  we must conclude that the government want fewer cctv cameras because the liberal democrats have consistently accused the last government of introducing a  surveillance state  i support cctv and reject the argument that it offends civil liberties  indeed  it protects the civil liberties of our citizens and  as we have seen recently  those of the occasional cat dropped in a wheelie bin  i agree with the minister for policing and criminal justice  the right hon  member for arundel and south downs  nick herbert   who  in 2007  wrote this it is excellent in his local newspaper  i had been shown a community centre on a council estate that had been burned down in an arson attack    if only there had been cctv  the attack might have been prevented or the perpetrator caught     to those who claim that this all heralds a big brother society  i say  why should innocent people worry that someone is watching out for their safety  the right hon  gentleman spoke for britain then  the vast majority of the population would support what he said  although sadly it is not the view of the pseudo libertarian government of whom he is now a member 
well  that went on a bit i am perfectly well aware of what kind of cctv caught the cat in the bin  mine was a throwaway remark  and i now wish that i had not thrown it away  but it is good to hear that the hon  lady believes that we went too far  and wants to reduce the number of cctv cameras  that is her point  is it not  good i can tell the hon  lady about the level of bureaucracy that will have to be introduced if the cctv cameras are to be taken away from catwoman s observer and every other private household  it simply cannot be done  as for cctv in public spaces  it is already governed by all the legislation that i mentioned earlier 
no  i will not give way again  it was tedious last time  and it would be tedious again  if the government want to strike a blow against the surveillance state  they should sack andy coulson  not take away cctv cameras we recently learned of another power that was due to be introduced  but is now held in suspended animation  this is a serious point  i refer to domestic violence protection orders  which received cross party support earlier this year  they are designed to protect instantly women and children who are under threat  acpo  the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children  women s aid and the home affairs committee urged their introduction to close a major gap in public protection  i pay tribute to my right hon  friend the member for leicester east  keith vaz   who chairs the committee there was no dispute whatsoever about the need for that measure  but although the home secretary has said that her ambition is nothing less than ending violence against women and girls  she presides over a regime that is threatening the enormous progress that has been made in tackling domestic violence over the last 13 years  there has been a 64  reduction since 1997  i am pleased to see that the attorney general is present  because he  with rather more grace than the home secretary  has recognised the significant increases in successful prosecutions and the sharp fall in the number of discontinued cases  as well as the amazing reduction in domestic violence  however  as the home secretary will agree  there is much more to be done in this crucial area thankfully  the government were forced into a u turn on anonymity for rape defendants mainly  i have to say  owing to the work of my right hon  friend the member for don valley  caroline flint   who pursued the issue tirelessly  i think that it is time to execute the same manoeuvre  and to get on with introducing domestic violence protection orders as quickly as possible 
the answer is quite simple  the home secretary ought to do some research  from 1998 onwards we did not need a strategy  because we had introduced an action plan involving the changes that led to the reduction to which i referred     interruption   the statistics that i quoted came from the attorney general and from the home office  if we had waited 12 years to introduce any measures to deal with this issue  we would not have reduced domestic violence by 64  as i said earlier  during the biggest global recession that we have experienced since the 1930s  crime fell by 9   during the recession of the 1990s over which the conservatives presided  it rose by 18   and domestic violence doubled  that was the legacy of the broken britain that we remember from those days  it is ridiculous of the home secretary to suggest that because we published a strategy to deal with domestic violence against women and young girls and then moved to the next stage  we did nothing for 12 years  we did nothing for 12 years except reduce domestic violence by 64   and produce all the other statistics quoted so generously by the attorney general i have dealt with the reduced resources being inflicted on police forces with restricted powers  let me now deal with the third part of the triple whammy  the imposition of elected commissioners to replace the hundreds of experienced councillors  magistrates and other citizens who sit on our police authorities  here we see the  we know best  arrogance of the government in all its depressing detail  the public did not vote for the abolition of police authorities at the general election  or for their replacement by an elected commissioner  this model is opposed by the police  by local councillors of all political persuasions  by acpo  by the association of police authorities  and by practically everyone who knows anything about policing the local government association  under a tory stewardship  says it does not believe that introducing directly elected individuals is the best way in which to strengthen police accountability  the association believes that such action will weaken the ability of the police  councils and other public services to cut crime  it could also  fragment local partnerships  and make a  place based budgeting approach  i am not sure what that is  more difficult  to operate  yet the minister for policing and criminal justice has said  we are not going to consider other models  this is the model we are going to introduce  that is the coalition agreement  and so we have a rushed white paper   policing in the 21st century   incidentally  the conservatives also produced one of these in 1993  it was called  a police service for the 21st century   so the titles do not change much but the content certainly does  they published the more recent document on 26 july for an eight week consultation period over the summer break  helpfully  at the back of the document there is a code of practice on consultations  which includes the criterion  consultations should normally last for at least 12 weeks with consideration given to longer timescales where feasible and sensible  irrespective of where we stand on the political spectrum  the topic under discussion is a major issue about which there are deep reservations  to quote from the code of practice  it is  feasible and sensible  to have a longer consultation than 12 weeks  there is no argument whatever to curtail it the first objection to the proposal is its puzzling inconsistency in relation to the approach to elected mayors  while a referendum is necessary if a city or town might have an elected mayor  no such public consultation is proposed for the equally profound step of introducing a single commissioner to replace the collective and diverse wisdom of police authorities and this  again  from a government who preach localism there is  of course  an attraction in direct accountability  indeed  when we were in government we looked at the issue not once  but twice  however  the difference between us and the dogmatic zealots who now occupy the treasury bench i excuse the attorney general from that is that we consulted properly  our 2004 consultation found overwhelming opposition to direct elections  respondents pointed out the dangers of extremist groups succeeding on low turnouts  single issue groups dominating  a move to a more short term approach with re election dependent on quick wins rather than long term objectives  the politicisation of accountable bodies and the lack of public appetite for elections and the cost of running them  however  the case for directly electing the 17 members of the police authority which is what we consulted on and which was liberal democrat policy at the last general election is much stronger than that for the replacement of police authorities by a single elected commissioner  this is the most ill considered and pernicious aspect of the proposal sir ronnie flanagan looked at this issue in his 2008 review  he expressed the great fear about a single person with a political mandate exerting pressure that too readily conflicts with operational judgment  he pointed out that it may also be an impediment to collaboration which  rightly  is a major part of the government s white paper since the vote for the post will be on localised issues rather than the largely unseen issues of cross border collaboration flanagan made a number of points from a policing perspective  but an even stronger argument concerns the loss of a body of people who are geographically diverse as well as diverse in terms of ethnicity  gender and background  the government propose a new body a police and crime panel to oversee the commissioner  that is meant to provide the checks and balances  the body will  however  have no say on policing and no veto over the commissioner s decisions  therefore  we face the prospect of having an elected commissioner who  as the white paper makes clear  will have a team of personal appointees  and a police and crime panel to overview the commissioner but not the police  whose overview will be conducted by a single commissioner whose decisions are final  somewhere in all of this will be elected councillors and in some places elected mayors  chief constables will have to find their way around this maze  with all the additional costs involved  while trying to cope with the biggest financial upheaval the police service has ever faced 
this is a very different issue from that of elected mayors  because they have a broad remit  we introduced elected mayors  and we agree that the mayor of london should chair the police authority  the trouble is that he finds doing that too hard  so he has stepped down and his unelected deputy is now chairing it  we agree with the mayor chairing it  however  that is very important to answer the hon  gentleman s question  i believe  as do many other members on both sides of the house  that the narrower a post s remit  the more difficult is the argument that we should elect someone to the post by individual ballot  which i presume is why the government are not suggesting electing the local leader of the health service or the local chair of an education authority  this is a fundamental argument  if there is a broad remit  part of which is policing  election is fine  but if someone is being elected to a post that addresses only one narrow remit  then i think it is wrong  i have serious concerns about this  and the flanagan consultation showed that they were widely shared 
i think that is absolutely right  and on this there is no difference between the front benchers  the government refer in their white paper to the  golden thread  of connectivity  that is a very important point  indeed  sir paul stephenson made it in a recent speech  it is more and more the case that police forces have to co operate across borders to tackle terrorism  cybercrime and serious organised crime several generations of police reformers in the usa have regarded the british model of insulation from political control as a solution to their problems of corruption and partisanship  they also consider that the fact that america has literally hundreds of police forces makes their job really difficult  the point is that they cannot go back  once this kind of measure is introduced  that is it  there is no return  i therefore think the government are being extremely foolish in going down this route  they suggest that there will be no political interference and that the commissioner s powers will be little different from those invested in a police authority now  which begs this question  what is this upheaval is for the government say there is the problem of the invisibility of police authorities and we agree  as do the apa and the lga  that is why so much effort is going into addressing that invisibility issue without jeopardising either the effectiveness of the really good people involved  who have served their communities well  or the crucial principle of the operational independence of chief constables i think there is a better solution and i offer it to the government in a spirit of political generosity  if the government are wedded to some measure of direct accountability i believe a solution might be direct elections for the chair of a police authority while leaving police authorities in place and certainly not causing this huge upheaval    interruption   i am sorry  but i did not catch the sedentary comment of the minister for policing and criminal justice  if he wants to intervene he can  i think that such elections would be a far better way forward and that the government should seriously consider that alternative  instead of the eight week consultation period  the government should opt for 12 weeks at least so that these issues can be properly debated  i also believe that if they decide to plough ahead with this they should at the very least give the local population a chance to decide in a referendum whether it wants to maintain the current system or move to a single directly elected commissioner on police powers  i say in the same spirit of political generosity that the government should maintain the dna legislation  which they supported in the pre election wash up  until 2012 when the database will have been in operation for six years  at that point there should be a review of the actual evidence  instead of us just having the projections that inform both our model of six years and the random guess plucked out of the air  which is how scotland came up with the three year option  then we can decide properly on the relative merits of the two models  otherwise we are going to wipe all the dna information from the database after three years and find out after six years that it is irrefutable that we needed to maintain that information for that length of time to catch murderers and rapists the government should also not reduce the number of public space cctvs  i do not wish to interfere with the cctvs outside mrs smith s house at 42 acacia avenue  we do not need to reduce cctv coverage in public spaces on the most important issue on police funding the home secretary has to fight her corner to ensure that policing and security are prioritised in the comprehensive spending review and that cuts in the police budgets do not exceed 12   as this government s honeymoon period draws to a close  they are vulnerable on many issues  none more so than crime and security  where the issue is not about political vulnerability  it is about the vulnerability of our citizens as they seek to go about their daily lives  despite the successes of the past 15 years  from howard to johnson  the battle against crime and disorder has to be stepped up  not scaled back  i warn this house and members on the government benches that the government are taking the wrong approach and that by refusing to listen and consult they demonstrate not their commitment to civil liberties  but their failure to protect the most important civil liberty of all  the right to be safe from crime and disorder 
 rose  
the right hon  lady really does need to follow the debate and to read the documents  some £75 million was to come from police overtime  £400 million from procurement and £500 million from process  this was all set out in the pre budget report  the budget and last november s policing white paper £1 3 billion worth of savings  the government can keep parroting that we have never set all this out  but the trouble is that we have and it is available to look at 
 indicated  assent  
i have been listening 
that is not true 
i shall say two things on this  those on the government benches are deriding michael howard so  first  i should say that it was the white paper called  a police service for the 21st century   produced under lord howard  that introduced all of the target regime and suggested that the home office should be able to appoint the chairs of political authorities  some of that was the right thing to do  i know that he is derided by those on the government benches  but michael howard was actually a very successful home secretary my second point deals with the hmic s figure on availability  hmic talks about the percentage of the police who are available at any one time to be on the streets  the police work in shifts  and some police officers are sick  some have to be in court  some deal with counter terrorism and some deal with child pornography  so that statistic is meaningless  many police officers have been quick to point that out  there is no way in which under the previous government that availability rate would have been any higher 
will the home secretary confirm that the figure  which is in the white paper  comes from the international crime victims survey  which was last carried out in 2004 and surveys 2 000 people in comparison with the british crime survey  which surveys 45 000 people and sometimes takes its statistics from those convicted  a very important point that was raised in an earlier intervention  and sometimes has nothing to do with the level of crimes  it is not a basis for saying that we have the highest crime rates in europe  will she confirm that 
i thank the minister for giving way  it will give him a chance to get his breath back i have said this consistently  and i will say it again very slowly  we set out in the november white paper  the pre budget report  the budget and other public documents savings of £1 3 billion over the next four years  that is about 12  of the home office budget  the hmic report  to which the minister referred  said that with a lot of effort it was possible to save 12  without affecting front line services  that is the argument
