i am grateful to the chancellor for advance sight of his statement  and to all the treasury civil servants  and those in hmrc and the department for work and pensions  who have been working incredibly hard to get these schemes running  i fully appreciate that the chancellor’s job has not been an easy one  but it is our job as a constructive opposition to point to problems that we are hearing from the frontline  and to indicate solutions  it appears that at least some of those problems are more acute in our country than in many others the purchasing managers’ index figures that came out last week indicated a sharp fall in business confidence  sadly  that was not a surprise  it has been clear for some time that the economic slowdown we are currently experiencing is sharp and deep  it was  however  unsettling that those figures suggested that business confidence has taken a stronger hit in the uk than across the eurozone  i have heard from small business owners who put their life and soul into their firms  but have less than two weeks of cashflow left  and they are devastated  we all need to work together to get the different support schemes working for our country  we must fix this i am well aware that many of the conditions for shifting out of lockdown are not within the chancellor’s grasp  however  his government need to be open about blocks on progress and how they will remove them  that applies to the test  track and trace regime  which must be in place before key sectors can open again  it also applies to the creation of a national tripartite system to ensure that workers and employers have confidence that they can return to work safely when the right time comes the chancellor is directly responsible for the economic package  and he knows that we supported him in creating the furlough scheme  indeed  we called for it  but the evidence is that some other key elements of the economic package are failing  so  in a constructive spirit  i want to ask the chancellor whether he would countenance solutions in three areas   first  on cbils  it is a relief to hear from the chancellor that he has listened to calls from  the opposition  business and others that we need a full guarantee for at least some loans   he has stated those of up to £50 000   but we need to be clear that the uk has an enormous mountain to climb  switzerland has a population of under 9 million  yet it approved four times as many loans in its first week as the uk has done in a month  we are running out of time  so how will the chancellor ensure that the bounce back loans get to the businesses that need them  how will they get out of the door  and what plans does he have to ensure that the banks will have the capacity to provide those loans secondly  recent figures suggest that one in 10 in our workforce looks set to be unemployed as a result of this crisis  with all that that entails for people’s future prospects  incomes  and their and their families’ health  again  i say to the chancellor that we will work with him  we have indicated many of the gaps in existing schemes to protect incomes  and will continue to push for them to be filled  however  we must be clear  the reason that those gaps are such an income crushing  insecurity producing crisis for so many is that  in most cases  the only alternative to coverage by these schemes is universal credit  which pushes people right down to an average of 10  of the income of the rest of the workforce  the dwp has made some welcome changes  but failure to change the initial loan into a grant threatens to create even more of a debt crisis among households  apparently the government are sympathetic to changing the loan into a grant  but we are told that the computer system just will not allow it  so my second question is  will the chancellor knock heads together and get the computers to say yes to switching uc loans into grants finally  as the chancellor knows  before this crisis we had an economy that simply did not work for so many  around a quarter of all families lacked just £100 in savings  even before the crisis began  the uk is the most regionally unequal country in europe  and we have just had the longest squeeze on living standards   not just in a generation  but in eight generations  the recovery from this crisis must be faster and wider to ensure that as many people as possible have a job to come back to  we need a flexible furlough scheme  the chancellor told me previously that it cannot currently be made more flexible  but other countries have done so  will he work to amend the furlough scheme to allow workers to come back on a part time basis  and will he do as so many other countries are doing  from germany to new zealand  and talk about how those hit hard by the crisis can be supported not just now  but in the future  with employment boosting redeploying retraining schemes  the aftermath of the pit closures tells us that an approach where the government shrug their shoulders will scar our economy for generations to come  so my last question is  will the chancellor work together with me  trade unions  businesses and local authorities to develop a plan to offer the hope of work to those who have already become unemployed  and get our economy moving again 
thank you  mr speaker  may i echo the financial secretary’s comments about the hard work that you and the parliamentary authorities have gone to  to ensure that these proceedings could go ahead  of course  as the opposition we are well aware of the need for government to have a legal basis to continue levying taxes  and we approach this bill very much in that spirit many of the clauses in this finance bill were written many months ago  with a large number of them involving relatively minor fixes to existing tax legislation   not exactly the vegetable waste and pig swill that the financial secretary referred to in his colourful and wide ranging perorations  but none the less in large part delivering technical aspects of already announced policies  in fact  overall  this bill presents a picture of continuing the business as usual of the last 10 years however  it is unthinkable that we will go many months before additional fiscal measures will need to be brought in by this government  there will be an urgent need to stimulate the economy as and when we move out of the lockdown  and when boosting consumption will not threaten to damage disease containment  other measures may well be needed to help alleviate some of the numerous supply side problems caused by the current dislocation finally  of course  we will need to deal with the considerable burden created by the costs necessarily incurred in fighting coronavirus  subsequent finance bills will need to be very different from this one  and i want to use the time i have available to spell out why  we will need new approaches to taxation generally  the social contract with business  funding public services  the climate crisis and tax reliefs  i will deal with each area briefly in turn first  we of course need a different and fairer approach to tax  the bill largely continues the previous framework  with its reductions in the tax paid by the very best off people  while support for the worst off has been reduced  the financial secretary will  i am sure  be aware of the institute for fiscal studies analysis of the distributional  consequences of successive budgets since 2010  as of 2019  for example  due to changes in tax and social security  the poorest 10  of households have seen losses of 11  of their income  on average  as a direct result of reforms  among those with children  the losses amount to 20   that is £1 out of every £5 being removed from low income families with kids  large numbers of frontline careworkers fall into that category  we know from recent research by the resolution foundation that half of careworkers are not paid the real living wage  and tens of thousands appear to be paid even below the national minimum wage  they deserve better  in contrast  the best off 10  of people have seen losses of only 2  in their incomes due to tax and social security changes since 2010 as all in this house will remember  george osborne maintained that  in his recovery  80  of the reduction in debt should come from cuts to spending and only 20  from tax changes  yet the latter went alongside cuts in income tax  inheritance tax and capital gains tax for the very best off people there is already a lively debate about how we should deal with the costs incurred by the coronavirus  the academic consensus is that decisions taken to load the cost of debt on to spending cuts in the 2010s made our recovery slower than it would have been otherwise  so it was the slowest not only in a generation but in eight generations  and slower than in many other countries  i am not saying that to castigate the government  i am saying it because we will need to adopt a radically different approach to future finance bills from that seen over the last 10 years we are currently feeling the impact of that decade’s fiscal approach very keenly  especially when it comes to uk households’ resilience  a quarter of uk families entered this crisis with less than £100 in savings   making it impossible for them  for example  to buy a new cooker or get their car fixed   and almost 2 million households did not even have a cooker in their home in the first place  as and when we return to what will be a very different normality  we must have building up financial resilience at the core of future finance bills  that will mean instituting a more progressive tax system  with those with the broadest shoulders contributing to services that benefit us all secondly  we will need a new social contract with business  as discussed at length during the statement  huge numbers of businesses are currently struggling like never before  we have already discussed the government’s economic package today  and i must emphasise again that there is a very strong expectation from the public that public support must translate into protecting jobs  not the extraction of value into already deep private pockets we have called for the government to consider the examples of other nations  such as france and denmark  as well as that of the labour government in wales  when approaching the bail out of different large firms  jobs must be retained  workforces must be supported  and we should expect and require good corporate behaviour going forward  that means a ban on public funds being passed into tax havens or doled out immediately in dividends  no share buy backs on bailed out companies  and a commitment to improvements in environmental performance in future we also need a renewed focus on dealing with the enablers of tax avoidance and evasion  i regret that we still do not see that when it comes to those who facilitated disguised remuneration loan arrangements  while those who received such arrangements continue to be affected by the loan charge the bill rightly rows back on the government’s previous ill advised commitment to cut corporation tax further to 17   by maintaining it at 19   the obr estimated that a cut to the latter rate would reduce receipts by £5 4 billion a year in three years  recent reductions in corporation tax have not boosted investment in the uk  it was clear that such a reduction simply could not be afforded in current circumstances  and we therefore welcome that element of the bill  when we talk to businesses  as i am sure government members do regularly  rates of corporation tax are not the headline reason for locating in the uk  other factors are far more important  such as workforce development and training  logistical factors such as transport  and   critically   business rates  which are a key issue for many companies in our nation there is  of course  an imbalance in the taxation of those businesses based in fiscal property compared with internet based businesses   the division between bricks and clicks  the bill details the digital services tax   a new 2  tax on the revenues of search engines  social media platforms and online marketplaces that derive value from uk users  we welcome that tax to the extent that it recognises the comparative under taxation of many digitally provided services  but we are concerned about the restricted scope of the measure  it means  for example  that amazon will continue to pay a lower rate of tax in relation to revenue than many high street bookstores and other retailers  in addition  it fails to fill the gulf in unpaid corporation tax from many of the largest technology firms  taxwatch uk has suggested that the uk is losing £1 3 billion in corporation tax from just five of those firms  and the digital services tax would make up less than half of that the current crisis suggests that digitally based businesses will amount to an even larger part of our economy in the years to come  so we need to get this right  above all  our government need to be more explicit about their discussions with international partners about the move to a formula based corporation tax system  given the ability of those firms to shift profits between countries  we must work with other countries to apportion taxing rights better the oecd’s anti base erosion and profit shifting project was a good start  but it failed sufficiently to inform countries in the global south  i hope ministers will be more forthcoming in future about what they are doing to seek that international consensus  not least given current hostility from the us towards multilateral approaches in a number of areas  this topic is controversial  and we need to hear more than just that our nation is engaged in those discussions i hope ministers will be more forthcoming in their approach when it comes to local government finance  which is crucial in providing public services   from social care  to helping the homeless  to providing areas for leisure and play  local authorities will be crucial in helping to rebuild the economy after this period  through their work on economic development my third point concerns the need for the government to commit to a proper  deep and wide review of local government finance that takes account of the full impact of the crisis in terms of extra expenditure and forgone income  and which considers business rates and council tax in the round  we still only have a commitment to yet another restricted review of business rates  surely we can be more ambitious in that area  as the need for a deeper review is now very strong  the goal must be to provide certainty and stability about the provision of local public services an additional area where action is needed is tackling the climate crisis  survey evidence  albeit tentative at this stage  suggests a renewed appetite from the public to grasp the challenges posed by the need to decarbonise  the bill makes small moves in the right direction  it incrementally increases vehicle excise duty  using emissions as a benchmark   the chief secretary to the treasury mentioned that   and it introduces the world  wide harmonised light duty vehicles test procedure  a un established vehicle testing procedure  in an attempt to prevent the gaming of emissions standards by vehicle manufacturers  we encourage the government to adopt a steady replacement of all testing procedures within that framework  more broadly  we need a far stronger shift in taxation to disincentivise carbon production  the previous finance bill continued implicitly to support fossil fuels in a number of areas  and this one only sets the scene for some elements of the promised new plastics tax and the new emissions controls that will be necessary  given that we have declared a national climate emergency in this very house  we need far stronger action in subsequent finance bills finally  we fail to see in the bill any substantive change in the government’s approach to tax reliefs  this is essential  public funding will be under pressure  so we must choose very carefully what we subsidise through these reliefs the incidence of tax reliefs has increased over recent years  yet there is little thorough oversight of their impact  labour has called repeatedly for a thorough review of tax reliefs  but this bill does not deliver one  as public finances come under substantial pressure  that position is no longer sustainable the national audit office’s recent report on tax expenditure showed that the government are not reporting costs of over two thirds of reliefs  that must change  alterations are made in this legislation to entrepreneurs relief   that was right to state   but the institute for fiscal studies has suggested that the £1 million limit is still too generous  furthermore  it does not achieve its principal aim of boosting investment  with the ifs stating “if one of the aims of reduced capital gains tax rates on business assets is to incentivise individuals to invest more in their businesses  this evidence suggests they are not working ”we must ensure that corporate tax reliefs are focused on employment retention and promotion  and the provision of public goods  that is as essential for entrepreneurs relief as for the hundreds of others that continue to receive little public scrutiny there are many measures in the bill that are sensible  that tidy up anomalies and that make life easier for taxpayers and hmrc  and we welcome them  but  as i have said  in many ways this feels like a finance bill for a different age  subsequent budgets and bills will need  to recognise the need for a much more resilient household financial situation and much more resilient public services  and will need to move away from the demand sapping  confidence stripping approach that has characterised the response to the last crisis  we stand ready to work with the government where we can to achieve that new approach 
to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if he will make a statement on the government’s economic package in response to the covid 19 outbreak 
thank you  mr speaker  for granting this urgent question  i would also like to wish the chancellor many happy returns as a constructive opposition  we want to work with the government to ensure that people’s jobs and incomes are protected and the furlough scheme is a critical  element of that  many of the more than 6 million people who are currently furloughed were taken aback by comments made in the media by government spokespeople suggesting that  for example  people needed to be weaned off an addiction to the scheme  there were many intimations that changes might have been announced to that scheme by the chancellor  potentially in the media  without the opportunity for proper scrutiny i have only heard about these changes in the last few seconds  we will look at them very carefully  but there are some critical principles that the chancellor surely must follow as he redesigns the scheme first  we must acknowledge that people did not want to be furloughed  it occurred through no choice of their own and through following the government’s advice about the closure of sectors  it is critically important that they are not penalised for that choice i welcome the flexibility mentioned  we have asked for that repeatedly  it applies in many other countries  it has been a long time coming  but i welcome the fact that it is occurring now that flexibility includes an employer contribution  so the chancellor needs to provide more information about that employer contribution now  he also surely needs to provide more information about alternatives to the scheme  other countries have job creation  training schemes and redeployment schemes  we do not have those yet  will the chancellor work with me  trade unions  businesses  local authorities and further and higher education institutions to create the support that is so desperately needed 
labour supported the introduction of the furlough scheme  and we have consistently called for it to become more flexible  we recognise that it cannot persist forever  however  according to press reports  the treasury is considering asking all employers to pay 40  of employee wages on the jrs from 1 august  which risks a massive spike in job losses 
i appreciate the chancellor’s comments  but we really need clarity around whether he is considering evidence from other countries  which  in many cases  are calibrating changes to their salary backfill schemes with the lifting of the lockdown  is he looking at that evidence  particularly on the potential impact of unemployment  or is he only looking at potentially the introduction of a uniform contribution from 1 august 
 urgent question   to ask the chancellor of the exchequer  if he will make a statement on the economic outlook for the uk and the government’s strategy to protect jobs and the economy in light of upcoming changes to the furlough scheme 
the oecd’s global outlook suggested that the reduction in gdp in the uk due to the current hit of coronavirus will have been the largest out of all developed economies  the enormity of the economic impact appears confirmed by the claimant count and other unemployment data out today  it seems that the slow and confused health response is being followed by a slow and confused response to saving jobs  despite the huge long term costs of unemployment  labour has called for an exit strategy  but what we seem to have is an exit without a strategy  including on jobs will the treasury change its one size fits all approach to the furlough and self employed schemes  which risks additional waves of unemployment  will it act to encourage young people to stay in education and training  and out of unemployment  will it build on previous schemes such as the future jobs fund to support the young unemployed  and provide tailored help for other hard hit groups such as older workers although more support for apprenticeships is desperately needed  it will not be enough  will the treasury act now to create the extra support that cannot currently be delivered by department for work and pensions staff  who are occupied with huge numbers of extra claims  will the government catch up with other countries that have already announced their stimulus packages  given that many employers are deciding now on whether to retain staff  will they apply conditions to government investment to include requirements to promote upskilling and re employment  above all  rather than a limited budget statement in july  will the government set out the back to work budget that we need  with a focus on jobs  jobs  jobs 
the chancellor stated earlier that the job retention scheme is being wound down from the autumn  it is actually being wound down from the start of next month across all sectors at the same time  and we are already seeing the impact of that in very substantial redundancies  the resolution foundation called this week for a targeted continuation of the scheme for the hardest hit industries and those areas affected by additional lockdowns  the chancellor has said he does not want to pick winners  but this health crisis has involved governments designating losers  quite rightly  for public health reasons  so why is he persisting with the one size fits all removal of the job retention scheme  when this will inevitably lead to additional redundancies 
i have to say that it is disappointing to hear that the chancellor is not budging from this position  as mentioned  it is already leading to additional waves of redundancies   avoidable redundancies in many cases  labour has repeatedly called on the government to match the ambitions of labour’s previous future jobs fund in developing support for unemployed young people  so may i ask the chancellor why  put together  the traineeship fund and green jobs challenge fund   just  announced   amount to less than a quarter of the size of the future jobs fund  that hardly reflects a focus on jobs  jobs  jobs 
our country has been through a great deal over these past few months  hundreds of thousands have wrestled with this terrible disease  for many months  people have had to go without being able to embrace their loved ones or even to say goodbye  tens of thousands have died  our nhs  social care and other workers had made extraordinary sacrifices  we owe them so much the government have had to take big decisions  too   we acknowledge that   but today should have been the day when our government chose to build a bridge between what has been done so far and what needs to be done to get our economy moving again  it should have been the day when the millions of british people worried about their jobs and future prospects had a load taken off their shoulders  it should have been the day when we got the uk economy firing again  today  britain should have had a back to work budget  but instead we got this summer statement  with many of the big decisions put off until later  as those on the government benches know full well labour is a constructive opposition during this time of crisis  we will not criticise for criticism’s sake  but when the government fall short we will speak up  and the blunt truth is that we have one of the highest death rates in the world and among the deepest economic damage in the industrialised world from coronavirus  so the very first thing the chancellor must do is prevent additional economic damage due to the slow public health response of his government as we have seen throughout this crisis  the failure to match soaring rhetoric with meaningful action has consequences for people across our country  despite all their talk  the government have failed to create a fully functioning test  track and isolate system  that has damaged public confidence and  in turn  harmed consumer demand  despite all their talk  the government have failed to produce a clear system for local lockdowns  the lack of timely information sharing has led  as we all know  to the imposition of an additional wide scale lockdown in leicester the government’s contracts with outsourcing firms amount to almost £3 billion  but we still have not got test  track and isolate working properly in the uk  as it is in many other countries  and the government still have not got a grip on the low value and limited scope of sick pay  risking people’s ability to self isolate  fear is corrosive  fear is hurting our economy  the government have got to get this right of course  we welcome the government’s announcement today of targeted vat cuts on hospitality and tourism and of vouchers to be used in restaurants  local businesses desperately need that support  and so many low and middle income people in particular really need help right now  that is why we have repeatedly called for social security to better meet their needs and prevent people risking losing their homes  if delivered properly  these measures should help but the chancellor himself said  when interviewed on “the andrew marr show”  that the best the government can do to boost demand is to give consumers and workers the confidence and psychological security that they can go out to work  to shop and to socialise in safety  so please  chancellor  work with your colleagues so our public health response catches up with that operating in other countries  the prime minister asked  what have i been doing about that  my party has been repeatedly suggesting solutions to the public health problems facing our country  and we need to adopt them in the uk before this crisis becomes even more severe now the government must act not just to deal with unemployment as a symptom  but also with its cause  research reported this week in the “telegraph” indicates that british workers have already been the biggest casualty in the global jobs cuts  it showed that while jobs markets in many other countries have already fully recovered  in britain it could take comparatively much  much longer for vacancy levels to return to normal  the levels of unemployment that this country saw in the past were not just an economic waste  they ruined lives  we are seeing the same impacts again   the same devastated high streets and communities robbed of their pride and purpose of course the re employment bonus announced by the chancellor is necessary  not least because his government refused to put conditions on the use of those funds related to employment  but  first  how can he ensure that that money will not just go to those employers who were already planning to bring people back into work and  secondly  what will he do for those firms that lack the cash flow to be able to operate even with that bonus  related to that  the chancellor still needs to abandon his one size fits all approach to  withdrawing the job retention and self employed schemes  no one is saying that those schemes should stay as they are indefinitely  the opposition have never said that  but we have said that the money spent on the job retention scheme must not serve merely to postpone unemployment  the scheme must live up to its name  supporting employment in industries that are viable in the long term  we also need a strategy for the scheme to become more flexible so that it can support those businesses forced to close again because of additional localised lockdowns  there is still time to avoid additional floods of redundancy notices  it is the government’s duty to help britain through this and stop employment reaching mass levels again we need action to ensure the support needed for key sectors of our economy   for our small and medium sized enterprises and our manufacturers  while we of course welcome the long overdue arts and culture package  we still have not heard the government’s plans for other sectors  many of us expected to hear them today  but we have not  the project birch process has been slow  tortuous and opaque  large parts of industrial britain need help to get through this   to keep their employees in jobs and keep their suppliers in jobs  meanwhile  it appears that there will be no solutions for smes who cannot take on additional debt until the autumn  this risks many smes going to the wall until now  the chancellor has described a targeted  sectoral approach as the treasury “picking winners”  but the necessary public health measures have created losers  as the chancellor himself said just now  the government required many businesses to shut down to prevent the spread of this disease  supporting businesses that are viable in the long run but currently starved of cash flow is not a matter of “picking winners”  it is about protecting our country’s economic capacity for the future  failure to do so   to make the job retention and self employed schemes more targeted and focused and to support viable businesses   is driving up unemployment in this country  the claimant count is on course to top 3 million people in june   the highest number since the previous record in 1986  this is the chancellor’s record  and one that cannot and must not be worsened where unemployment arises as a symptom of economic damage  more must be done to help  labour repeatedly called for the government to match the ambitions of labour’s future jobs fund and welsh labour’s jobs growth wales programme  and finally the government have come forward with a scheme apparently modelled on them   the kick start scheme  the conservatives cancelled the future jobs fund  of course  and it has taken almost 10 years for them to catch up  as with their belated adoption of our call for “jobs  jobs  jobs”  perhaps this gives a new meaning to the phrase “project speed”  we now need to make sure that the kick start scheme provides genuinely additional opportunities for young unemployed people  the government must also recognise the specific challenges faced by older jobseekers  many of whom are becoming unemployed for the first time  and those based in especially hard hit places  reimposing sanctions now is punitive and counter  productive when jobseekers need support we must be ambitious for the future of our country’s economy  our ambition should not just be to build our way out of this but to do so in a greener and cleaner way  for this  we need more than the reheated announcements  by the prime minister last week  of course the investment announced was welcome  not least because much of it was already committed to by the government  however  core elements are missing  for example  £50 million to support retrofitting in social homes is just a seventh of what the conservatives said they would be spending every year  the muddled confusions over stamp duty over the past 48 hours reflect a broader lack of strategy when it comes to house building  particularly for genuinely affordable and social homes  overall  the uk’s green investment package barely touches the sides of other countries’ commitments  even with what was announced today  it only equates to just over the value of germany’s investment in one green technology alone   hydrogen  the committee on climate change has indicated how far behind the uk is in the race to decarbonise  failure to heed its recommendations is not only damaging to our planet  but it also cuts us out of leading the development of the key technologies of the future  the conservatives are still refusing to impose conditions on investment to ensure that it contributes to the goal of net zero and that it supports local jobs  uses local firms  leads to sustainable skilled employment in local areas and prevents the use of tax havens and other forms of asset stripping if the chancellor really wants to “build back better”  he must prevent a rerun of the past  from 2010 onwards  we have seen how families’ resilience has been eroded  we entered this crisis with a quarter of families lacking even £100 in savings  in a typical classroom of 30  nine children are growing up in poverty  and our economy is the most regionally unequal in europe  our local authorities continue to be cut to the bone  with many standing on the brink of bankruptcy as we speak  and rather than the promise that our nhs and social care services would get whatever they needed this winter   to weather a potential second wave   those words were conspicuously absent from the chancellor’s speech just now politicians in this house have gone out on our doorsteps to clap key workers  while the lowest paid have struggled to keep a roof over their heads  we must have a new settlement for the future  an end to poverty pay for our social care workers and those who clean our hospitals and deliver our groceries  we want a recognition of the value of the work of those who have been taken for granted for far too long there were some initial press reports that the government were due to announce generalised tax increases or cuts to services this autumn  which were contradicted by the prime minister  who rejected whatever had apparently been briefed out by the treasury   that has happened quite a few times  i say to the government that  if they do increase taxes during the recovery and cut back on the public services that we all rely on  it will damage demand and inhibit our recovery  labour is not calling for tax rises  we are calling for growth the tory manifesto committed to no rises in income tax  national insurance or vat  and therefore it is for the conservatives to set out how any additional spending will be paid for  it is the chancellor’s job to ensure that the economy bounces back from this crisis  so that there is money in the coffers to protect the public finances last week  the chancellor’s colleague  the prime minister  tried to claim the mantle of fdr   as we all know  perhaps now we know why he went for roosevelt  it is because this week the prime minister blamed carers for the failings in the system that his government had  underfunded for the past decades  now we know why he went for roosevelt  it is because the last thing that his government would have wanted was the sign on the desk of harry truman  the successor to roosevelt  which said  “the buck stops here ” if this government had a sign  it would probably say  “the buck stops anywhere but here”  but they cannot escape their responsibilities  to govern is to choose  it is to choose to finally sort out test  track and isolate  to prevent unnecessary additional unemployment and to build the green jobs of the future  this is a moment when our country needs its government to help britain through
