i thank the home secretary for updating the house on the refugee crisis and welcome the further measures she has announcedtoday  we have worked together well in the past and although i will of course provide real challenge in this role  i shall do so constructively at all times may i also take this opportunity to praise my predecessor and friend  my right hon  friend the member for normanton  pontefract and castleford  yvette cooper   she showed great leadership in forcing the government to face up to the scale of the crisis and i am sure that the whole house wish her well in her continuing role on these matters unfolding across europe and the north of africa is a humanitarian crisis on a scale not seen since the second world war  more than half a million migrants have arrived at the eu’s borders this year  about double the number that came in 2014  terrible images of families and children in great distress continue to fill our television screens  earlier this week  four babies  six boys and five girls were among 34 victims who lost their lives after their boat capsized between turkey and a small greek island  with winter approaching and temperatures in many of the countries affected about to drop  an urgent solution is needed  so may i begin with the government response to date the measures announced last week   in response  it has to be said  to huge public pressure   were  of course  welcome as far as they go  the prime minister and the home secretary are right to say that the uk has set the lead on aid spending and we must urge other european countries to match it  although the appointment earlier this week of a minister with specific responsibilities is a welcome and sensible development  we now need clarity on the headline figures the government have committed to 4 000 refugees a year  although the prime minister has suggested it could be more this year  what is their latest assessment of how many will arrive this year and how many does the home secretary expect to arrive before christmas  what discussions has she had with councils about the practical arrangements  more than 50 have offered to help  are they actively turning those offers into practical proposals and  given the concerns that councils have expressed about funding  is she working to get a better funding arrangement for them will the home secretary say more about the situation in calais  how many of the people in camps there have had their status assessed and what discussions is she having with her french counterpart to progress that situation  the big question  of course  on the government’s response to date is whether it is in any way commensurate with the scale of the crisis  david miliband  chief executive of the international rescue committee  said earlier this week that the uk government’s commitment on an annual basis matches only the numbers arriving in greece on the beaches of lesbos every single day  with that in mind  is the home secretary really standing by the description of the government’s response to date as adequate  does she accept that it must be kept under constant review and  if necessary  increased let me turn to the european response and the justice and human affairs council meeting on monday  such is the sheer scale of the challenge  the home secretary is right to say that it can be met only through a co ordinated european response  although she was right to call for the meeting  it is disappointing  to say the least  that the uk government failed to table any practical or positive proposals to help our european neighbours  can wereally leave greece  with all the other economic problems it faces  to cope with the situation alone  the expert help is good  but it goes no way to meeting the scale of the emergency greece faces although we understand that the government do not want to give an incentive for people to travel across the mediterranean  they cannot deny the reality on the ground in europe right now  the home secretary describes the arrivals as the fittest and the wealthiest  is not that a dangerous generalisation  does it adequately describe the people   the desperate parents carrying children at the hungarian border and the children sleeping on the streets in greece  is the government’s decision not to take any refugees from europe sustainable from a moral and practical point of view  although i understand the government’s reluctance to take part in the proposed quota system  surely an offer of some help would live up to the historic tradition our country has always had  if the government were to provide that help  would not that only build good will and help the renegotiation discussions in advance of the forthcoming european referendum the home secretary will know that chancellor merkel has called for a summit of european leaders to broker a solution  will the home secretary today commit the government to a positive response to that call  one of the problems the summit will have to address is the management of borders within europe  does the home secretary agree that the ability to move without checks can leave people in the grip of people traffickers  what is her view on germany’s decision to reintroduce border controls  and what implications does she think that will have for the schengen agreement will the home secretary say more about the proposal for removal centres in transit countries in africa  she says they must become operational immediately  when does she expect that to happen  is the approach of moving people back to transit centres consistent with the principle set out in the dublin convention  whereby people have the right to claim asylum in the country of arrival is the eu in discussion with other countries across the middle east to increase what they are doing  lebanon  turkey and jordan are doing what they can  but surely they need more help from other  wealthier countries in the region finally  we have heard today about the deployment of hms richmond to the mediterranean  with a specific role to board ships and intercept people traffickers  although we welcome that development  will the home secretary say more about how it will work in practice and whether it will work as part of an international effort to disrupt those gangs in conclusion  this is possibly the biggest crisis of its kind in our lifetime  and the way in which we respond to it will define us as a generation  we need to be ready to do more  if the necessity demands  and reach out to our european neighbours whose challenges are greatest  and we must honour our country’s long tradition of providing refuge to those who need it 
on behalf of everybody on the opposition benches  may i echo the home secretary’s tribute to police constable david phillips  who died working to keep the people of merseyside safe  i am sure that the whole house will want to join me in sending a message of condolence to his family and of gratitude for his service to the public today  the former head of the supreme court  three law lords  a former director of public prosecutions  five retired court of appeal judges  a president of the european court of human rights and 100 qcs who represent the government have described the home secretary’s response to the refugee crisis as “deeply inadequate”  why does the home secretary think that she is right and all of them are wrong 
let me tell the home secretary why i repeated the question  could not the public have legitimately expected the home secretary to answer a question about the biggest humanitarian crisis since the second world war  her response reveals her fixed mind on this issue  which is simply not good enough because she is not responding to the unfolding nature of the crisis  her position is flawed for one reason  she is trying  out of convenience  to draw a false distinction between refugees still in the region and those who have arrived in europe  whom she describes as the wealthiest  fittest and strongest  i say to her  look at the tv pictures today  these people are not wealthy  fit or strong  they are desperate and they need our help  is it not time to stop digging in  show some humanity and reach out a helping hand 
it will not have escaped the house’s attention that the home secretary has struck a markedly different tone in her opening remarks this afternoon from the one she struck at her party conference in manchester last week  the change in tone is very welcome  but she said at her conference  in contrast to what she said just a moment ago  that the overall economic benefit of migration is “close to zero”  can she today give the house some evidence to back up that claim 
i beg to move that this house  whilst affirming its belief that there should be firm and fair controls on illegal immigration including new immigration enforcement powers and immigration status checks on current account holders  and particularly welcoming proposals for a director of labour market enforcement and to strengthen sanctions to be applied to employers of illegal workers  declines to give a second reading to the immigration bill because the measures overall in the bill will not decrease illegal immigration  will reduce social cohesion and will punish the children of illegal immigrants for their parents’ illegal immigration  because the government has failed to publish the report on the pilot right to rent scheme in the west midlands which could cause widespread indirect discrimination and because the bill enables the home secretary to remove from the uk migrants who are appealing against a refused asylum claim before the appeal has been determined  notwithstanding the slow appeal process and the high error rate in home office decisions let me start by setting this debate in an essential and important piece of context and with a point that the home secretary skated over at the start of her speech  the most recent evidence is clear   immigration provides a net benefit to our economy  it is not  as was claimed last week  “close to zero” but  according to authoritative and independent research  can be quantified at around £25 billion  that migrants contribute more to the publicpurse than they take out is a simple fact that cannot be repeated often enough in debates such as this  similarly  in the nhs  we are far more likely to be treated by a migrant than to stand behind one in a queue  the culture and identity of our country   for centuries an open  outward looking  seafaring nation   has itself been shaped by centuries of inward immigration  and it is all the richer for it 
i can refer the hon  gentleman to it  it is research carried out over a number of years by imperial college  and i will be happy to send it to him  i suggest that he should perhaps spend more time looking at the evidence about immigration  rather than resorting to rhetoric  as i know he is wont to do all of that having been said at the beginning  the nature and scale of immigration to the uk has changed in the past decade  particularly since the expansion of the european union into eastern europe  anyone who spent any length of time on doorsteps in the first half of this year cannot dispute the fact that immigration remains one of the highest concerns of the public  and the truth is that public and political debate has failed to keep pace with public concern  resulting in a feeling that the political class is out of touch 
that would be a good point at which to bring in the hon  gentleman 
i shall come on to that    hon  members  “ah ”  it is a fair point and i shall come on to it  may i again refer the hon  gentleman and his colleagues to the research  the ucl centre for research and analysis of migration talks about the positive economic benefit of migration overall  he needs to concern himself with the evidence before he intervenes in the house as i said a moment ago  the house has not kept pace with public concern  and as i said in my speech to the labour conference  i want to change that  people listening to debates in the chamber or in the media will often hear politicians and business leaders make the point that i made at the beginning   that immigration provides an overall net benefit  although this is true  and to take the hon  gentleman’s point on board  what such broadstatements fail adequately to acknowledge is that the effect of immigration is not uniform across the country  but that it has a differential impact in different areas some of the most rapid changes have been felt in the poorest areas and former industrial areas away from the big urban centres  in my constituency  immigration has had an impact on job security  wages  access to housing and public services  but parliament has been far too slow to acknowledge and act on those concerns  the danger is that that creates a vacuum and allows myths to flourish 
i am afraid i have to point out to the home secretary that she was not entirely factual at the dispatch box this afternoon  she said that the previous government did nothing to restrict access to the nhs by illegal migrants  as health secretary i brought through measures to restrict access to the national health service  what i am setting out in my remarks today is a balanced approach  which she failed to do in hers  i recognised at the beginning the overall benefits of immigration to this country  but i am acknowledging that there are specific and legitimate concerns that need to be dealt with  because a failure to do that creates a vacuum and allows myths to flourish given that  the right response is certainly not to respond in kind with rhetoric  but instead with practical and proportionate measures to restore public confidence that our system and our rules are both firm and fair 
there have been barely any prosecutions because the government have cut the resources devoted to enforcement  i welcome the home secretary’s proposal to create a director of labour market enforcement  but will she ensure that that director  whoever he or she is  gets to grips with the problem that my hon  friend has just raised 
my hon  friend is absolutely right  the challenge is to capture the benefits and then have rules that make immigration work for everybody  let me give him two practical suggestions that i have put forward  first  i believe that we need changes to the eu free movement rules  as part of the renegotiation talks  to stop the undercutting of wages and protect the going rate for skilled workers  secondly  i believe that unspent eu structural funds  which this government are not drawing down  should be made available through a rapid migration fund to areas  such as his and mine  that face the biggest pressures on public services  for example to employ extra primary school teachers and gps  at the moment those areas get no help in dealing with those pressures  so no wonder they feel neglected 
the hon  gentleman makes an important point  overall  refugees tend to be younger and not to have dependants  consequently  the figures i gave at the beginning  which show that they net contribute  rather than take out of the public purse  must be borne in mind when we engage in a debate of this kind several hon  members rose   
i will make some progress before giving way again as our reasoned amendment makes clear  we are prepared to support practical  proportionate and evidence based measures that will achieve the stated aims of tackling illegal immigration and illegal working 
i am afraid that the right hon  lady has not learnt the lessons of her experience in manchester last week  when she made a number of assertions without having the evidence to support them  she has got the evidence that overall there is a net contribution   she just quoted it  she  more than anyone else in this house  should stick to the evidence at all times and not resort to rhetoric several hon  members rose   
i will give way in a moment  after i have made some progress i have said that we will support measures to create a director of labour market enforcement  building on legislation passed by the previous labour government  particularly the gangmasters  licensing  act 2004  we also support many of the measures set out in part 3 of the bill to improve enforcement and equip immigration officers with all the necessary powers to do their difficult job in a more complex and changing world  i am pleased to see the government acting to address the weak points in the uk border  particularly at smaller regional airports and seaports  we support the measures set out in part 6 to tackle problems before people arrive in the uk by extending the reach of the border force into uk territorial waters 
when i mentioned that  in reply to my hon  friend the member for dudley north  ian austin   i said that we wanted measures to protect the going rate  and then i heard noises from the government benches  where were they when we were trying to get through the agency workers proposals and the posted workers proposals  if government members now support putting a floor beneath all british workers  that is a major conversion  but one that i welcome  let us have a renegotiation that strengthens the workers’ rights provided by europe  rather than stripping them away  these are the changes that i want to see  let us protect the wages of electricians and plumbers  let us not allow them to be undercut by agency workers who come in and are employed on the minimum wage  beneath the wages of the skilled workforce  if we can agree on that ahead of the eu referendum  that would be a major positive consensus that we could take to the british public several hon  members rose   
i will give way to the hon  member for ochil and south perthshire  ms ahmed sheikh   who has been very persistent 
i am not responsible for all labour party merchandise  i did not purchase one of those mugs and i am not particularly proud of them  however  if the hon  lady is saying that there should be no controls on immigration  i am afraid that we will have to part company on that  because there do need to be firm and fair rules to ensure that our immigration system works in the public interest several hon  members rose   
i will give way once more before making some progress 
i was surprised  a fact check was issued on that very point  and it is quite clear that the central estimates in the paper by ucl’s centre for research and analysis of migration suggests that european immigrants have made a net contribution of around £20 billion  and immigrants outside europe make a small net contribution of around £5 billion     interruption   the home secretary seems to dispute this  but that is why she got into trouble last week  because she did not have balance in her speech  if she is not careful she is going to develop a reputation for lacking balance on this issue 
no  i am going to make some progress the other measure that we support in the bill is the requirement for all front line public service staff to speak fluent english  which of course is a sensible proposal  however  i believe that  in legislating on these matters  we all have a responsibility to bear in mind at all times that this is the most difficult and sensitive of policy areas  unlike other issues that we debate in this house  this one has the potential to cause real harm and strife in our communities we will support the government when they get the balance right  but i want to be clear about what we will not do  we will not support legislation that is introduced in haste or that is not backed up by clear evidence  that is the problem with the bill  parts of it appear to have been drafted on the same beer mat and in the same pub as the home secretary’s speech to the conservative party conference in manchester  it is legislation driven by a desire to be seen to be doing something and to get headlines 
i think that is where the home secretary is beginning to cut an isolated figure  as she did last week at her party’s conference  i understand that her own cabinet colleagues are making the same argument to her   the chancellor of the exchequer got dangerously close to making the same argument on his recent trip to china  the hon  lady is right  if we are looking for an area where there is economic benefit to the country inthe long term  it is absolutely that of welcoming to this country students who will then commit themselves to the country for the rest of their working lives the critical response to the home secretary’s speech last week did not come just from the usual suspects on the labour benches  the daily telegraph called it“awful  ugly  misleading  cynical and irresponsible” while the institute of directors  no less  dismissed it as“irresponsible rhetoric and pandering to anti immigration sentiment”   serious words  they were not alone  the public can spot any attempt to play politics with this issue from a million miles away  and that is why the home secretary got the reaction she did  she claimed in manchester that immigration was undermining social cohesion  i put it to her that legislating in haste without clear evidence and bringing forward half baked  divisive measures is far more likely to do precisely that 
i stood alongside him and he said no such thing  so i will move on from that pointless intervention a number of organisations   amnesty international  the united nations high commissioner for refugees  the equality and human rights commission  justice  the tuc and the joint council for the welfare of immigrants   have expressed serious reservations about the bill  they believe it could damage social cohesion  force children into destitution  undermine efforts to tackle human trafficking and modern slavery  erode human rights and civil liberties  and lead to widespread discrimination let me take those issues in turn  starting with the potential for discrimination  clause 12 in part 2 amends the immigration act 2014 to make it a criminal offence for a landlord to rent premises to an individual with no immigration status  punishable by five years in prison  the measure is intended to underpin the national roll out of the government’s right to rent scheme  as the home secretary said  i am not against asking landlords to carry out reasonable checks of identity documents  as they already do  but there are a couple of points to make  first  landlords are not border or immigration experts  they are not trained in reading official paperwork from around the world  and they are not experts in spotting forged documents  so on what basis are we planning to outsource immigration control to them  will not the regulatory burden that this will impose on landlords be way beyond the capacity that many can manage  secondly  given all that  is it really proportionate to threaten them with jail  and will not that have a major impact on the housing market and the way it works the house will recall that in the previous parliament the government tried to bring forward the same proposals  but given the huge implications  not least for private landlords  they were forced to back down and pilotthem  a commitment was given to this house that the findings of the pilot would be presented to us before the government proceeded any further  that was the commitment given by those on the front bench  we learned yesterday that that commitment will not be honoured  although the home office has conducted its study  it will not present its findings until the committee stage  that is not good enough  this house should not be in a position where it is being asked by the home secretary to vote tonight on measures that could have a huge impact in every constituency represented here today without evidence for what those measures might do  it is not just a discourtesy  it is downright dangerous  she is asking us to be complicit in legislating in haste  and this house should have none of it let me explain why  we know that right to rent could cause widespread discrimination  not just against migrants but against british citizens  in the absence of the government’s study  an independent survey was carried out by the joint council for the welfare of immigrants  it found that in the west midlands  the pilot area  42  of landlords said that right to rent had made them less likely to consider someone who does not have a british passport  while 27  were now more reluctant   as my hon  friend the member for brent north  barry gardiner  has said   to engage with those with foreign accents or names  those are very serious findings  why on earth is the home office not presenting its own information to the house so that we can establish whether it is correct 
the jcwi believes that the figures i quoted are likely to underestimate the scale of the problem because of the nature and timing of the survey  but also because the problems are likely to be magnified much further in london  where there is a much bigger private rented sector and many more migrants  it says that“these proposals will only…deepen the discrimination”that already exists against people like those in my hon  friend’s constituency who are seeking a tenancy when is the home secretary going to publish these conclusions  and why are we in this position today  in failing to produce the evidence  she has simply not made the case for the measures that she wants the house to vote on tonight  this is a major change in the law and she has not made the case for it thankfully  the days when landlords displayed unwelcoming notices in the windows of their lodgings are gone  hopefully for good  but these document checks could legitimise a new wave of discrimination which  by being hidden  could be far harder to challenge  only last week at the conservative party conference  the primeminister highlighted how young people from black and asian backgrounds face discrimination when they send out their cv  purely on the basis of their name  he was right to do so  and it was refreshing to hear it from a conservative prime minister  but if he was really genuine  this question follows  why is he legislating to create exactly the same situation   the same everyday discrimination   in the housing market against people with foreign sounding names  if he really believed what he said  he should ask his home secretary to think again let me turn to employment   another area where there could be major unintended consequences if the bill passes in its current form  i said earlier that we support measures to tackle illegal working that build on the immigration  asylum and nationality act 2006  which i helped to take through as a junior home office minister  but we have major reservations about the new offence of illegal working in clause 8  in the words of justice  “it is unnecessary and risks undermining important efforts made over recent years to address issues such as trafficking and modern day slavery ”justice does not believe the assurances that were given to the hon  member for brighton  pavilion  caroline lucas  by the home secretary  the sanctions that could be applied to an individual range from confiscation of wages right up to imprisonment  justice says “fear of prosecution and imprisonment is likely to deter the vulnerable  such as trafficked women and children  who are working illegally from seeking protection and reporting rogue employers and criminal gangs ”what evidence can the home secretary give the house to show that that would not be the case  more broadly  this new offence will merely strengthen the arm of unscrupulous employers and reduce the likelihood of any employee coming forward to report them  for that reason  rather than tackling illegal working  is not the bill likely to have the opposite effect and potentially increase the size of the black economy 
justice does not accept the assurances that were given by the home secretary  i can therefore tell the hon  lady that we will co operate with her in committee  if she takes part in it  to get those assurances into the bill  because she is right to call for them let me turn to human rights and civil liberties  the bill extends the power of the executive in a number of troubling ways  part 4  as the home secretary said  proposes a major extension of the “deport first  appeal later” approach from foreign national offenders to all human rights claims  what case has the home office made to persuade members that it can safely be given such sweeping powers  it has hardly covered itself in glory over the years with the speed or quality of itsdecision making  let us remember that this is a department that today has a backlog of over 300 000 immigration cases   a department where up to 50  of the initial decisions that it makes are found to be wrong on appeal  with these figures in mind  are we really ready to give the home secretary much greater powers to remove migrants before their appeals have been determined  again  the government are asking us to legislate before the impact of the last extension has been fully evaluated  the equality and human rights commission says that  by denying people the ability to be present at their own appeal  the bill is potentially in breach of articles 6  8 and 13 of the european convention on human rights i ask all colleagues on both sides of the house to think  before they vote tonight  of the genuine cases they have dealt with and the people they have got to know at their surgeries whom they have rightly helped to stay here in challenging a home office decision  they should think of them before they legislate to allow people in a similar position to be removed without being able to attend their own appeal 
i think that in their heart of hearts a lot of government members are not able to support the measures  because they have seen in their surgeries cases similar to that mentioned by my hon  friend  they will know people who would have been deported if this bill had been in place and who would not have been able to exercise their legitimate right to be present in person at their own appeal  that is why my hon  friend is right to say that this is wrong the bill also extends the power of the executive to override the independent decisions of the first tier tribunal with regard to immigration bail  it also allows the home secretary to impose bail conditions  including executive electronic tagging  that raises important issues about the rights of people in our judicial system  and it could undermine the independence of our courts  again  what confidence has the home office given us that it can be trusted with those powers  there is evidence that  under the coalition government between 2011 and 2014  £15 million was paid out in damages for unlawful detention and abuse of the powers the home office already has 
personally speaking  in my view those people and children should not be in detention  we need to take a look at how this country has approachedthese issues over a number of years  i would be happy to work with the hon  gentleman on a cross party basis  to address those issues  that is what we should do my final concern with the bill relates to vulnerable children    interruption   these are important issues and the hon  member for northampton north  michael ellis  would do well to listen to them before rushing into the lobby to vote for the proposals without any evidence to support them clause 34 proposes to remove support from families with children  let me be honest   that was piloted by our government  but it was rightly abandoned because of the effects it had  in a parliamentary debate in 1999  when those provisions were suggested  it was said that“all children on british soil should be given the same protection…no child should go without protection…we are concerned about the welfare of children  who should not suffer under any circumstances  whoever their parents are and whatever their basis for being in the country ”     official report  16 june 1999  vol  333  c  418 421  those are fine sentiments  and they came from the then conservative opposition  i say to government members that what was right then is right now  no child should face destitution in our country  whoever they are  wherever they come from one of the most powerful moments in the prime minister’s conference was when he talked about his response to the photograph of alan kurdi  it was powerful because it spoke to our common humanity and our instinct to protect children  whatever their circumstances  that is why the bill is not supportable until those measures have been dropped in conclusion  the house will notice that we have not gone down the route of outright opposition in framing our response  as i said at the beginning  there are measures we support and we have set them out in our reasoned amendment  however  when balanced against the other concerns that i have highlighted in my speech  the scales tip towards preventing the progress of the bill if the government are prepared to change the bill to address the fundamental problems i have outlined  i would be prepared to reconsider our position  as long as they stay in  however  we will take a stand against them for what is right and for what we should represent as a country the truth is that the bill is driven by the wrong motive   a desire to be seen to be doing something  to generate headlines  that is the problem that lies behind it  such is the scale of the government’s failure on immigration  as my hon  friend the member for dudley north said  and such is the size of the gap between the rhetoric and the reality  that they are now resorting to ever more drastic  desperate measures to give the impression of action the government promised to cut net migration to tens of thousands  it currently stands at a record 330 000 and there is no evidence to suggest that anything in the bill will bring that down  there is evidence  however  to suggest that it could cause real harm in every constituency represented in this house government members might be happy to legislate without evidence  but we will not follow them  we will give no support to a government pandering to prejudice and legislating in haste to make britain a more hostile and unwelcoming country  that is why i move thereasoned amendment standing in my name and those of my right hon  and hon  friends  if it falls  i will ask the house to oppose this unpleasant and insidious bill 
i am grateful for the spirit in which the hon  gentleman has introduced his remarks and for what he has said  he talked about right to rent  does he agree that  in the absence of any evidence from the government on the pilot  we have to accept what has been produced by the joint council for the welfare of immigrants  as i said in my speech  its findings are extremely troubling  if we accept those findings  it is impossible to support the bill tonight because of its potential to cause widespread discrimination against british citizens too 
as well as providing him with a little more time  i would like my right hon  friend to consider the effect on his constituency and mine of the changes to the immigration rules that the government want to introduce with respect to earnings  this could force a lot of nurses currently working in the nhs to leave the country  nurse training has been cut and the nhs isover reliant on agency staff  now the government are about to force thousands of nurses to go back  does he agree with me that we need a rethink and a change of heart on this issue 
i welcome the home secretary’s comprehensive and detailed statement  and the advance notice that she provided huge changes in technology have clearly left our laws outdated and made the job of the police and security services harder  in a world where the threats we face  internationally and domestically  are growing  parliament cannot sit on its hands and leave blind spots where the authorities cannot see  this debate will be seen through the prism of extremism and terrorism  but  as the home secretary said  it is about much more  it is about child sexual exploitation  serious online fraud and other important functions  such as the location of missing people we support the government in their attempt to update the law in this important and sensitive area  we share the government’s goal of creating a world class framework the opposition’s position is clear  strong powers must be balanced by strong safeguards for the public to protect privacy and long held liberties  from what the home secretary has said today  it is clear to me that she and the government have listened carefully to the concerns that were expressed about the draft bill that was presented in the last parliament  she has brought forward much stronger safeguards  particularly in the crucial area of judicial authorisation  it would help the future conduct of this important public debate if the house sent out the unified message today that this is neither a snooper’s charter  nor a plan for mass surveillance    hon  members  “hear  hear ” on behalf of the opposition  i echo the home secretary’s thanks to the intelligence and security committee  rusi and  in particular  david anderson  qc  who has done the house and the country a huge service by setting out the basis for a new consensus on these important matters  will the home secretary tell us whether david anderson has expressed a view on her draft bill  whether he supports the measures within it and whether he is satisfied with the checks and balances on powers and safeguards the house will want reassurance that the bill carries forward the safeguards from previous legislation  particularly the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000  such as the threshold for the use of the most intrusive powers  will the home secretary assure the house that the far reaching powers of content interception will be used for only the most serious crimes  as was the case under the original legislation we welcome what the home secretary said about internet connection records and local authorities  but the house will have been listening carefully to what she said about data retention and bulk storage  will she say more about what kind of data will be stored by the authorities  for how long it will be stored and whether the information will be held in anonymised form  that is important because public concern will have risen following the attack on data held by talktalk  people will have heard her say at the beginning of her statement that 90  of commercial organisations have experienced a data breach  what lessons has she drawn from the talktalk attack  does she believe that there is a need to enhance the security of bulk storage arrangements in both public and private bodies on encryption  the prime minister spoke some months ago about the possibility of introducing a ban  clearly  that is not the policy that the home secretary has just outlined  will she explain the reason for the change in approach  alongside the proposals on encryption  it is clear that the bill will place a range of new legal duties on communications providers  will she tell the house whether all the major providers support her proposals  including those who are based overseas  i listened carefully to what she said on that point  she implied that the measures in the bill would not apply to organisations that are based overseas  that suggests that there is a large hole that the legislation will not cover  will she say more about that and reassure us on whether there will be voluntary arrangements in that area will the home secretary say whether the measures will apply to individuals  there is rapid change in the development of online applications  so we need to know whether individuals might be liable the whole house will welcome what the home secretary had to say about the wilson doctrine  but she did not mention journalistic sources  will she say whether the legislation will provide protection in such cases my predecessor made a key demand in the crucial area of authorisation  which i have reiterated  we are pleased that the home secretary has listened  the two stage process that she advocates seems to have the merits of both arguments  it will provide public and political accountability  and the independence that is needed to build trust in the system  there may be a worry that it will build in delays  will she say more about how the two stage process will work in practice and how delays will be avoided  will judges sign off warrants in all cases  if the secretary of state and the judge come to different conclusions  who will have the final say finally  as well as looking at the specific proposals in the bill  it is important to look at the wider context in which they are being introduced  the home secretary will know that there are fears in some communities  particularly the muslim community  that the powers will be used against them disproportionately  we have seen in the past how police powers have been wrongly used against trade unionists david anderson rightly laid great emphasis on the need to build trust in the new framework  it does not help to create the right context when the prime minister suggests that the entire muslim community quietly condones extremism  nor does it build confidence in the new bill when  at the same time  the government are legislating in the trade union bill to impose new requirements on trade unionists in respect of the use of social media and on the monitoring of it by the police  as the right hon  member for haltemprice and howden  mr davis  said  “this isn’t franco’s britain”  can the home secretary see that to continue to build on the trust she has created and the good start that she has made today  the government should drop some of its more divisive rhetoric and measures  starting with the measures in the trade union bill in conclusion  the issues the proposed legislation seeks to tackle go way beyond party politics  any government will face a difficult task in balancing the security of the nation with the privacy and liberties of individual citizens  as someone who was in the home office on 7 7  i know that that challenge has got harder in recent years  we will examine carefully the detail of the draft bill and seek to improve the safeguards to build trust  having listened carefully to what the home secretary has said today  i believe that she has responded to legitimate concerns and broadly got that difficult balance right 
i beg to move that this house notes with concern the loss of 17 000 police officers in the last five years  further notes the most recent police recorded crime statistics  which show sharp rises in some of the more serious crimes including knife crime and sexual assault and that  alongside evidence that some crime is rising  there is evidence that crime is changing and moving away from traditional forms such as burglary and car theft and is being increasingly replaced by cybercrime  is concerned by reports that the police budget could face between 25 and 40 per cent spending reductions in the forthcoming comprehensive spending review  notes warnings from senior police figures that this could result in over 20 000 further reductions in frontline staff  the effective end of neighbourhood policing and much of the public being exposed to much greater risk  accepts that further efficiencies can be made in the police budget for england and wales but believes that budget reductions over 10 per cent would be dangerous  further notes the ongoing concern surrounding the scottish government’s oversight of police scotland and the findings of the recent staff survey which found only 30 per cent of staff thought they had the resources necessary to do their job properly  and calls on the government to secure a funding settlement for the police that maintains frontline services and does not compromise public safety i rise to speak to the motion in my name and those of my right hon  and hon  friends  at the start  i should thank the hon  member for mole valley  sir paul beresford   who is about to leave the chamber  old alliances forged over the cause of water fluoridation do  in the end  stand one in good stead  i am grateful to him we have just been discussing the powers that the police and security services need to keep us safe in the 21st century  i would be the first to argue that the house has a duty to provide those powers  alongside strong safeguards  but that is of course only half the story  alongside the powers  we need the people to put them into practice  that bit was missing from the home secretary’s statement  in the 19th and 20th centuries  britain led the world in policing  because our policing by consent model was based on investment in good people with a strong sense of public vocation  in the 21st century  crime is changing   it is moving online and becoming more complex   but what will never change is the simple principle that the foundation stone of good policing is that presence in every community and the building of those strong relationships at local level it therefore feels right to pay tribute at the start of this debate to police officers and police civilian staff  what unites this house is a deep sense of gratitude to the men and women who work every day to keep our constituents safe and put themselves in harm’s way to do it 
my hon  friend anticipates me  because that is going to be at the heart of what i say today  i am sure that she  like me  feels great pride in what the last labour government did to invest in neighbourhood and community policing  those changes have been noticed by the public and have built confidence locally in policing  and that is now at risk 
my right hon  friend rightly says that there is evidence that violent crime   knife crime and sexual assault–is on the increase and that the metropolitan police have seen some reductions  particularly in her community  the big worry is that if the government proceed with the spending plans they set out at the budget  thousands of police officers could be taken off the streets of this country  particularly in london  where the change would be most keenly felt  that should concern members on both sides of the house 
i will make a little more progress and give way later on last week  the shadow policing minister and i joined the home secretary and the minister for policing  crime and criminal justice at the police bravery awards  as i am sure we would all agree  it was a humbling evening  it was particularly poignant this year  with pc david phillips in the minds of many  we think of david’s family today  and we hope that they take some comfort from the huge public response and outpouring of feeling that we have seen as i said when i started this job  when the home secretary gets it right  she will have my support   i have just offered that to her on the investigatory powers bill   but where she and the government get it wrong  i am not going to hold back from saying so  particularly where public and community safety is at risk  that brings me to my central point  this government are about to cause serious damage to our police service and if they do not change course  they are about to put public safety at risk 
my hon  friend tempts me on to important ground  we are considering today not only the overall size of the cake for the police   how much money the police budget gets from the spending review   but how that cake is then divvied up  this week  pccs of all political colours  have come together to say that the rushed changes to the police funding formula could seriously destabilise our police services  i would be interested to know what response the government will make to the letter they have received 
that may well be the case   i do not know  as i have not seen the details  may i gently point out to the hon  and learned lady  however  that that is not the position everywhere  i refer her to the comments the chief constable of lancashire made yesterday before the home affairs committee  he said that if these cuts go through “people in lancashire will not be as safe as they are now” the chief constable of cumbria has said that that force may not be viable  and we face the closure of police stations across the country  complacency will not serve conservative members well in this debate 
that is the point  we are already hearing that police services in england and wales are overstretched and struggling to cover all their functions  that is because in the past five years 12 000 full time officers have been lost   the total was about 17 000 police staff overall  three weeks from now  the chancellor of the exchequer will be standing at that dispatch box announcing his spending review  if he follows through on what he said at the budget  the country will soon have a very different police force  providing a much reduced service than the one that has just been described  as it stands  the home office  like other unprotected departments  is in line for a cut over the next five years of between 25  and 40   if we assume that the government are working to keep it to the lower end of that spectrum  it still represents a massive hit on resources  it will mean 22 000 fewer police officers than we have today  that is a massive number and the government need to provide justification for cuts on that scale 
i will come on to deal with that  explaining clearly what we think could be done and what takes us into the realms of dangerous cuts  the hon  gentleman glibly says that crime is coming down  but he just heard what my right hon  friend the member for enfield north  joan ryan  had to say a moment ago  we know that crime has moved online and that the crime figures have not yet been updated to include those cybercrime figures   5 million crimes  i do not believe it will serve the government well if they continue to exhibit complacency on these matters  there is good evidence to show that crime is not falling  but is in fact rising 
the hon  gentleman makes a very valid point  and i will come back to it later  i am not standing here today saying  “no cuts  things have to stay exactly as they are  there is no room for efficiency in the police service ” of course there is room for efficiency  my right hon  friend the member for normanton  pontefract and castleford  yvette cooper  commissioned a report from the former met commissioner sir john stevens in the last parliament  he identified scope for savings of the kind that the hon  gentleman just described  i am not saying that there is no room for cuts  the core of my argument is this  yes  make those efficiencies  but there comes a point beyond which the government will be beginning to unpick the fabric of our police service and to put local communities at risk  and i am not prepared to see that 
i am glad that my hon  friend made that intervention  because it was a really important one and those on the government front bench needed to hear it  they all shook their heads when she gave that figure of £25 million  lancashire is not making that up  people are not speaking out for the sake of it  doubtless the government will want to accuse them of scaremongering  but this is nothing of the sort  senior police are speaking out about what is happening  they can see that the proposed budget cuts  combined with the new funding formula  could seriously destabilise community and neighbourhood policing several hon  members rose   
i will give way in a moment that brings me to my first question for the home secretary today  i have just described how we saw cuts to frontline services in the previous parliament  i have also said that we are looking at cuts of possibly up to 25   what evidence can she point the house to today that says that the government can safely shrink the police by a quarter from its current overstretched position and not put public safety at risk  in fact  what evidence is there that she can safely cut the police by 20   15  or even 10   we would love to see it  but i do not think that we will  i do not think that that evidence even exists  this is what is happening  we are being asked to accept major changes to the police without the evidence to justify it 
the home secretary should give those comments her full attention  the figure that my right hon  friend has just quoted is backed up by independent research that i have commissioned  it suggests that if the cuts go ahead   cuts of around 25    london could see 5 000 or 6 000 police officers lost from the frontline  i know that he will do what he can to oppose those cuts and the funding formula in the coming months  i look forward to seeing others on the government benches doing the same  and standing up for the people of london as i know that he will 
my hon  friend puts it very well  let us look at what merseyside has said about what the proposed cuts would do  it has said that they would mean scaling down teams dealing with sexual assault and hate crime  those are very serious implications  where is the evidence to justify cutting the police on that scale  i have not seen it  i hope we hear it today  because this house cannot give permission to the government to proceed with these cuts until they have made the case for what they are trying to do 
my hon  friend puts her case very well  crime may indeed be changing  and moving away from volume crime  such as car crime and burglary  but that is not to say that crime is falling  as i have said before  online crime is not adequately reflected in the crime figures  she rightly says that there are worrying increases in the most serious crimes in a number of areas  including in our part of the world  in greater manchester 
i will make a little progress if i may  and take some further interventions later i was just saying that i do not see the evidence to shrink our police force back to the levels of the 1970s  leaving us with fewer police officers per head of population than other comparable countries  that brings me to my second question  which is not for the home secretary  but for the whole house  if there is no authoritative evidence that cuts on this scale will not put our constituents at risk  how on earth can we allow them through  we have called this debate today for the following reasons  to challenge the government on what we feel is a reckless gamble with public safety  to give voice to the deep disquiet felt by thousands of police officers across all 43 forces in england and wales about the future of policing and community safety  to initiate a proper debate about the future of policing and the needs of our communities  in advance of the spending review  and to alert the public to the enormity of what is at stake by launching a national campaign today to protect our police  just as with tax credits  i cannot remember the public being told about these plans to decimate neighbourhood policing before they went to vote 
if the hon  gentleman is going to intervene in the debate  he should at least listen to it  a moment ago  i said that we put forward plans for efficiencies before the election  so it would not be a sustainable position for me to say  “no cuts at all”  and i am not saying that today  what our motion says is that cutting the police by more than 10  would put public safety at risk  if he thinks that it is fiscally prudent to do that and damage public safety  then i beg to differ with him  i would love to see how he can justify cuts of more than 10  in his community 
i do not think that they do  cuts on the scale proposed would mean the effective end of neighbourhood policing as we have seen it in recent years  particularly in rural areas and areas of lower risk  we would see thousands of bobbies taken off the beat  it would take us back to the bad old days of reactive and remote policing  with officers retreating to cars and to the station  they will not be out on the streets or visible in their communities 
false economy is absolutely the point  is it not  the government do not seem to equate the reduction in crime we had in the last decade  which began under our government  with the investment in those community safety teams  that brings me to the role of police community support officers  one of the innovations of the labour government of which i  for one  am very proud indeed  under the government’s plans  they will become an endangered species  we know that they do not enjoy the same employment protection as warranted officers  so no doubt they are worried that they will be the first to go one of the gains brought about by pcsos was that they substituted for warranted officers on lower level duties  such as managing the remembrance sunday parades we will see in our constituencies this weekend  around the country  some of those parades are beginning to be scaled back and even cancelled because there is not sufficient police cover  is it not a sure sign to the conservatives that if the police can no longer cover events of such importance to our local communities their cuts have already gone too far 
civilised society  that is what matters here  if people want a glimpse of what the future might look like  they should have a look at tiptree in essex  where residents already have to club together to fund their own private security guards  is that the kind of society we want  with private security guards roaming the streets in areas where the police have withdrawn  the government deny it  but that is what is happening on the ground this is not just about the loss of capability in community and neighbourhood policing  forces are talking about disbanding mounted sections and dog sections  the cuts could have serious implications for the police estate  with police station closures all over the country and the police becoming a blue light only service  responding to emergencies and not dealing with crime at a local level 
i agree with the hon  gentleman that that should be considered  but i am afraid that i am not going to be to let him or the scottish national party off the hook  the survey referred to in our motion says that only 30  of officers in scotland feel that they have sufficient resources to do the job  i accept that that might partly be the responsibility of the westminster government  but i am not sure that the changes to the police in scotland and the move to police scotland have resulted in the improvements that we were told would happen as i said only a moment ago  the police have spoken about becoming a blue light only service in places  in their briefing for this debate  lancashire police state “we will attend fewer crimes ”that prompts the question of which crimes  where is the national public guidance on the crimes that can now safely be de prioritised  again  there is none  because the government would rather pass the cuts and pass the buck down to a local level  leaving the public facing a confusing postcode lottery in policing if anyone believes that referring to a postcode lottery is an exaggeration  may i refer the house to the pilot scheme in leicestershire  where the police attended burglaries only at houses with even numbers  a scheme that the government claimed worked and that could now be expanded  at what point have we as a society or this parliament accepted the principle that the police will no longer attend someone’s home if they have been burgled  at what point have we accepted the principle that some victims of crime can be abandoned in this random fashion  we have not  and i do not believe that this house should concede that principle  policing practice should not be changed in such a way until the government have provided sound justification for the change 
i can do no better than refer my hon  friend to the words of peter clarke  former deputy assistant commissioner of the met’s specialist operations directorate  whom the house will know  talking about what is in the offing  he said “we risk breaking the ‘golden thread’ that runs through the police effort all the way from local communities to the farthest part of the world where  in an era of global terrorism  defence of the uk begins” that is the point  that pyramid of policing that begins at a very local level and feeds intelligence into the system is not an either or idea  we cannot just say that we will have officers dealing with online crime and withdraw people from the streets  we have to maintain a police presence in every community  which is a point that the government seem not to understand 
however  i believe that the former policing minister does understand that 
i am glad that the right hon  gentleman intervened  because i am not saying anything of the kind  i am not saying that the cuts that the government have managed to date have been without consequence  i have just described how functions as important as managing remembrance sunday parades have been cancelled  i have also pointed out that crime is rising and i  for one  do not say that there is no link between police numbers and rising crime  we looked at a plan to protect the frontline by merging police forces  i note that the government have turned their face against that  it is all about how they do it  the frontline can be protected if the government are prepared to manage the cuts in a way that takes resource out of the back office  they are not prepared to do that  either  so consequently we are seeing unacceptable cuts in police forces up and down the country 
“proportion”   people will hear how the home secretary is trying to spin it  let us deal in people  shall we  rather than proportions  between 12 000 and 13 000 officers lost  police community support officers lost  and all at a time when crime is beginning to go up  she wants to take away 22 000 more  i say in all sincerity to the home secretary that with crime on the rise this is no time to cut the police 
everybody will remember very well the terrible fire and the consequences of the riots on the streets of croydon  people would expect promises like that to be kept  would they not  but with this prime minister and this government  they are rapidly learning that such things are said in the moment to look good but are not followed through  sadly  that is the hallmark of this government the government are sending the police on a dangerous journey without a route map  where is the white paper that sets out the case for these drastic changes to the police and the vision for the police service of the future  where is the expert analysis of the changing nature of crime and society and therefore of the resource needs of the police  in the absence of all that  the only justification put forward by the government  as we have heard today  is that despite reductions crime has continued to fall  i have dealt with that  madam deputy speaker  i believe that in the last decade the reduction we saw was linked to the investment in neighbourhood policing and we are now beginning to see signs that crime is on the rise again the truth is that this whole process is not being driven by our future needs as a society  or by the changing nature of crime  it is a crude  treasury driven process that owes more to an ideological drive to shrink the state than to the good governance of the police and our public services  what we will soon be left with is the police service of the treasury’s dreams but the public’s worst nightmares 
i think that the hon  gentleman will regret those remarks  listen to what senior police officers are saying  is he accusing them of scaremongering  is he saying that peter clarke  whom i quoted a moment ago  is wrong  has he talked to his own constituents recently and heard their views about visible neighbourhood policing  i suggest that he speaks to them  because this is not about what politicians want  his constituents want to see a strong uniformed presence on their streets  keeping them safe as i have said  it is not just about the overall size of the cuts  because the home office  in characteristic fashion  is taking a bad situation and making it worse  the changes to the police funding formula     interruption   the policing minister should not dismiss this  because the letter he received this week was a pretty difficult and sobering one for him  it talked about a process that is“unfair  unjustified and deeply flawed” that is how his own conservative colleagues describe it  it is highly critical of ministers’ handling of the whole process  which they say was“entirely avoidable and wholly unacceptable” they are now looking at a judicial review  those are strong words  and is not the fact that it is conservative voices saying them a clear indication that the government are no longer carrying their own side  and that they are losing the confidence of the police as a whole where do we go from here  a good start would be to put implementation of the formula on hold  let me get to the heart of what we are calling for today  as our motion makes clear  we have not turned our face away from the idea of savings in the police budget  because there are changes to back office structures and procurement that could protect the frontline  if one speaks to senior police officers  one realises that most accept that further savings of up to 5  are difficult but doable  cutting between 5  and 10  gets more dangerous  and the cuts would be harder to make  but neighbourhood policing would have a chance in that scenario  my message to the government is that if they cut the police by 10  or more  they will put the public at risk i hope that i can take it as read that the home secretary is fighting for the best deal she can get from the treasury  will she share with the house this afternoon what figures she thinks are acceptable without compromising public safety  if she can set out those figures  can she tell us where she thinks those savings can be made from within the police without compromising public safety  that is important  because her vision for the police needs to fit with the government’s other plans for public services  they cannot be seen in isolation from the rest of the spending review policing is the last safety net  and it will be forced to deal with the consequences of failure in other services  for instance  if the government fail to tackle the crisis in mental health services in the spending review  that will only add to the pressure on the police and on police cells  if they force councils to close youth clubs  leisure centres and playing fields  the chances are that antisocial behaviour will be on the rise again  if they fail to invest in social care  they will leave our hospitals in crisis  ambulances trapped in queues outside and police cars having to fill the gaps  if they fail to sort out the mess in probation  caused by underfunding and part privatisation  there will be a direct impact on re offending and  ultimately  public safety ultimately  that is the problem  what we are facing in this spending review is a drive to shrink back the state and then privatise it  in the response to this debate  we expect to hear plenty of talk about the deficit  yes  the deficit is important  but there is not just one way to close it  and it is not more important than the safety of the public and of the country this is a milestone moment for the police service in britain  the decisions that the government make on funding over the next few months will determine the mission and the manner of policing and community safety in this country for a generation  that was the warning given by the conservative police and crime commissioners in their letter to the government this week  this is an issue that they now have to explain and answer  it is simply not safe to cut the police in the drastic way they plan  and they have failed to set out a case that it is our motion makes a reasonable demand  put simply  it is to secure a funding settlement for the police that maintains front line services and does not compromise public safety  is there any conservative member who cannot vote for such a demand  or are they saying that they are ready to sacrifice public safety in the name of deficit reduction  it is not acceptable  and it will not be acceptable to their constituents  as it is not to ours opposition members understand the value of public service and public services  we have shown in the past that we can fight for our nhs  so we give notice to the government today that we are ready to do the same for our police and for the safety of our communities  i call on members on both sides of the house to think about what cuts on this scale will mean for their constituencies  put public safety before party politics and support the motion before the house tonight 
if i may correct the home secretary  i conducted the 2007 spending review as chief secretary and a decision was taken to grow public spending at a lower rate than overall growth in the economy   a decision that the current prime minister and the current chancellor described at the time as tough  the right hon  lady she needs to correct the record i want to ask the home secretary a direct question  and she cannot leave the debate today before she answers it  if she is saying that everything is fine  she now needs to tell the house at what level she thinks it is safe to cut the police before public safety is compromised  what is the percentage cut that she is prepared to make without compromising the safety of our constituents 
i am grateful to the home secretary for giving way one last time  we agree that savings can be made  but what we disagree on is the extent to which they can be made safely  my hon  friend the member for hornsey and wood green  catherine west  said that the home secretary is painting a rosy picture  and i think that police officers watching this debate will conclude that she is not living in the same world as them  this is not about what we on the labour benches are saying  chief constables from london to lancashire are saying that the safety of their public will be compromised if the cuts go ahead  does the home secretary think that those chief constables are scaremongering 
will the right hon  gentleman give way 
i am listening carefully to my hon  friend  because i recently had the privilege of meeting daniel morgan’s brother  who has campaigned with unbelievable courage over the years  my hon  friend should be in no doubt that although i am calling today to protect our police and for more resources  that does not mean that we should not learn the lessons of what happened at hillsborough  orgreave  shrewsbury and in the case of daniel morgan  we must hold that mirror up to the past if we are to build a police service that is ready for the 21st century 
rose   
i think the hon  gentleman is saying   the right hon  member for ashford  damian green  and other hon  members have also said this   that there is no connection at all between police numbers and levels of crime  is that seriously the argument that conservative members are putting to the house 
osborne says 25  
the hon  lady claims that the talk is speculative  but did she not read the budget documents published after the election  the home office is unprotected  and unprotected departments are looking at cuts of 25   that is why my hon  friend the member for birmingham  erdington  jack dromey  and her chief constable say that her constituents will be less safe if that goes ahead  is she happy to nod that through 
as we have heard  the whole house is united in sending its sympathy and solidarity to the people of france following the terrible events on friday  these callous attacks confirm the ability of isil to hit at the heart of europe and place an obligation on us all to redouble our efforts to protect the safety of our country and that of our neighbours  we welcome the government’s response to the weekend’s events and reaffirm today our commitment to work constructively with them  including on modernising legislation with regard to the powers of the police and security services  but of course  alongside the powers  we need the people to put them into practice  will the home secretary say more about the funding announced today by the prime minister to recruit 1 900 extra officers for the security services and whether that funding is additional to the counter terrorism budget 
i thank the home secretary for what she has said and appreciate that she will say more shortly  let me also say that the united message coming from this house today is that isil will not prevail in this attack on our values  we welcome the action that the government are taking in respect of the security services  but i am sure she will agree that the threat we face cannot be tackled by counter terrorism operations alone   it also depends on the capability of the police to respond to an emergency and  as sir ian blair said this morning  on effective neighbourhood policing to provide early intelligence  she will be aware of concerns within the police about the forthcoming spending review  in the light of the events in paris  are the government looking again at the requirements of the police and revisiting their assumptions on the police budget going forward 
thank you  mr speaker  may i strongly welcome the home secretary’s statement and many of the steps she has just announced  as we have come to expect  she has acted quickly and with clarity  and she will have our support in taking the action needed to protect the public here and across europe our thoughts today are primarily with the friends  the families and the loved ones of those killed or injured in paris  these horrific attacks on innocent people   as the home secretary said  many were young people  enjoying a night out   were an attack not just on france but on the way of life we all share  on our freedoms  our multicultural societies and our shared values  those responsible want to intimidate us  we will not let them succeed  we stand in solidarity with the people of paris and all the citizens of france the home secretary was right to praise the british intelligence and security services who work so tirelessly to keep us safe  much of what they do goes unseen and unreported  but  as we know  they have foiled many attacks here in recent times  they deserve our support and our gratitude two things are apparent from recent events  first  isil has now demonstrated that it has the capacity to hit mainland europe and cause widespread casualties  secondly  this is evidence of an escalation of intent  as alongside the paris attacks we have seen the downing of the russian airliner and the bombings in beirut  and victims of both of those atrocities should be in our thoughts at this time  this requires the international community to formulate an urgent and effective response let me start with the circumstances of the attack  what this atrocity reveals is how an attack on one member state can be planned and co ordinated in another  and by individuals who may not be known to the domestic security services of the state where the attack took place  what arrangements are already in place for co operation between security services across europe  can those arrangements be strengthened in the light of what has happened  and is there greater assistance that can be provided across europe between security services let me turn to border security  the schengen agreement is of course primarily a matter for the countries who are participants in it  but it does impact on our own border security  while any changes remain a matter for the participants  do the government have a view on the way schengen is operating  and are they making representations to those member states  can the home secretary say more about what she thinks the impact of the schengen agreement is on uk borders concerns have been raised in recent days about people travelling across europe in cars in the light of these attacks  and that becomes particularly relevant in respect of the measures at the channel tunnel  the home secretary said security there will be strengthened  can she assure the house that lorries and cars coming through the channel tunnel will be subject to the same security checks as passengers travelling through airports and using eurostar  is she confident that proper arrangements are in place at all regional airports  we welcome what she said about improving airport security  but are regional airports in a strong enough position to deal with the challenges they face let me turn to refugee policy  it is of course essential to remember that many of the people fleeing are fleeing the horrors of isil themselves  it is possible of course that one of the attackers in paris came through the refugee route  and the idea cannot be dismissed that this might have been an attempt to undermine public confidence in europe in welcoming genuine refugees to our country  the fact that europe is prepared to welcome people is a wonderful validation of our values  and we must not be deflected from that  but the policy raises certain issues  first  will the home secretary tell us what can be done to strengthen the processing and documentation of refugees as they arrive in europe  so that an up to date database can be maintained  secondly  would it be helpful if that information were to be shared quickly across the security services of europe  so that individuals who might pose a risk can be identified in regard to the high profile events that are coming up  particularly the football match between england and france this week  can the right hon  lady reassure the public that the necessary security measures will be in place to ensure that those events can take place safely  she mentioned the muslim community  and she was absolutely right to say that isil’s evil ideology is not a true reflection of islam  indeed  it is a perversion of it  however  the muslim community in this country will be feeling an extra sense of nervousness right now  what more can she say to reassure law abiding members of the muslim community that they will have our full support in dealing with this threat finally  let me turn to the powers and the funding of the intelligence and security services and the police  given the prime minister’s comments earlier today  does the home secretary anticipate a need for the investigatory powers bill to be expedited  we welcome her announcement of money for counter terrorism  but i urge her not to view counter terrorism in isolation from the general policing budget  she will know that the metropolitan police commissioner  sir bernard hogan howe  said last week that cuts above 10  to the police budget would hamper his ability to fight terrorism on the streets of london  today  ian blair has said that the loss of police community support officers from our streets would be a “disaster” responding to questions earlier  the home secretary said that it was not about the numbers of police but about the quality of the policing  of course it is about the quality  but it is also about coverage on the ground  the government have been talking about a 25  cut to the police budget  can the right hon  lady assure the house today that she and the chancellor will revisit those assumptions about the police budget in the light of what has happened  to ensure that the police have the funding they need to do the job this is the single biggest challenge of our generation  we need to avoid a knee jerk reaction  but we must not shy away from taking decisive action  we must act with resolve  with strength and with judgment  and we must build consensus  because the stronger we are together  the sooner we will defeat this threat  isil’s aim is to divide our communities  to divide us politically and to divide us from our european partners  with whom we share common values  the message must go out today that we will not let isil prevail  let us say clearly that it will not succeed and that we will stand as one in our communities and as a country  united with our european partners 
as the home secretary said  we have had a lively and thorough debate  if not a genuine dialogue  as the movement from the government has been minimal  we have not won many amendments but we have certainly won the argument  for that  i thank my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras  keir starmer  for the assured and expert way he led for the opposition on the bill  he was  of course  our star summer signing and  like one of mr wenger’s best from the old days  he has managed to outshine his considerable reputation already  with more to come i would also like to thank my hon  friend the member for rotherham  sarah champion   who brought an invaluable insight from her outstanding work on tackling the exploitation of children  and my hon  friends the members for south shields  mrs lewell buck   forworkington  sue hayman   for sheffield central  paul blomfield  and for blackburn  kate hollern  who served on the committee  our thanks go too to the co chairs of the committee  my hon  friend the member for ynys môn  albert owen  and the hon  member for wellingborough  mr bone   and to the third party organisations that the home secretary referred to  which made a very important contribution figures were published last week that i believe set the context for this third reading debate  the ons reports that net migration has reached a record high of 336 000   up 82 000 from last year and 101 000 higher than the level it was when the prime minister came to office  i heard the home secretary’s comments about the record of the previous government  she needs to have a look at her own record before she comes to this house and points the finger in this direction  that is the record of her government  let us set it against what they promised the conservatives’ 2010 manifesto made a solemn pledge to reduce net migration to “tens of thousands”  “if we don’t meet it  boot us out ” said the prime minister  the 2015 manifesto made the same pledge   and we now know that  rather than reducing net migration  the government are increasing it by tens of thousands  that is the home secretary’s record  and it is lamentable even by the standards of the government  the home secretary likes to go to the conservative party conference and talk a tough game  but the truth is that she cannot escape her own record  the very scale of the gap between her rhetoric and the reality continues to erode public trust on this most important and sensitive of issues as i made clear on second reading  i will always support practical measures to deal with the public’s legitimate concerns about immigration  and there are some measures in the bill that we support   particularly the emphasis on labour market enforcement and english language requirements in public services  what i will not do  however  is lend our name to desperate attempts to legislate in haste and to half baked measures that owe more to a pr exercise to camouflage a record of failure than a considered attempt to create the firm but fair immigration system of which the home secretary spoke we will refuse to give the bill a third reading tonight because the government have failed to listen in committee and failed to produce any meaningful evidence that the measures in the bill will have any more success than the steps that they took in the last parliament  worse  by legislating in this ill conceived way  they have produced a bill that could have a number of unintended and pernicious consequences  as my hon  and learned friend the shadow immigration minister so skilfully exposed in committee first  the bill could undermine all the progress made on tackling modern slavery and human trafficking   for which  actually  the government deserve some credit  secondly  the bill could leave desperate children utterly destitute  thirdly  it could lead to discrimination in the workplace and the housing market and erode important civil liberties and human rights  i shall take each issue quickly in turn i have real concerns that the creation of a new offence of illegal working could deter vulnerable people  such as trafficked women and children  from having the courage to come forward to report rogue employers and criminal gangs  those unscrupulous individuals already hold the whip hand  the tragedy is that the bill will strengthen their grip over these most vulnerable of people  the house should reject the bill  working to put food in your kids’ mouths should never be a criminal offence  more broadly  if employees fear losing wages or even imprisonment by coming forward to report employers  might not the effect of the bill be the reverse of what the home secretary wants  might it not actually increase the size of the black market those are genuine concerns and i have not seen any convincing evidence from the government to suggest that they are misplaced  although the government have remained unmoved during the bill’s passage through this house  i feel sure that their lordships will wish to push them hard on this issue in another place 
my hon  friend has more experience than anybody in the house of the workplaces that might be most affected by the bill  he is absolutely right to say that unscrupulous employers   sadly  they do exist in the construction industry   will feel emboldened by the bill  they will know that exploited people on building sites will no longer have the courage to report them to the authorities    interruption   the home secretary says that is “desperate”  but those people are desperate and she is putting them in a worse position  she needs to think about that before she puts the bill into law another concern is about clause 34  which removes support from families   a power that the home office has long sought  the proposal was put to me as a minister and piloted under the last labour government  the official evaluation of that pilot found no evidence of increased removals but plenty of families going underground and losing touch with the authorities  as my hon  friend the member for sheffield central said in the debate  there is also the shunting of costs from the home office to local authorities in the end  however  the question we need to ask ourselves is much more fundamental  should any child   whoever they are  wherever they come from   be denied food and clothes while they are on british soil  i do not think so and i would venture to say that most members on both sides would  in their heart of hearts  think the same  the great irony is that it was the then conservative opposition   specifically  the shadow home office team   in the last but one parliament who led the charge against what was then known as clause 9  they were right to force the then government to pilot this change  and we were right to drop the whole idea once the results of the pilot were clear  if what they said was right then  why is it not right now i congratulate my right hon  friend the member for normanton  pontefract and castleford  yvette cooper  on raising widely held concerns about the need for immigration rules that allow for the reunification of refugee families  she spoke powerfully about that  i hope that the government will continue to look at this  particularly at new clause 11  which calls for a review of the rules finally  i turn to the concern about the potential of the bill to increase discrimination and erode basic rights and liberties  we live in the most challenging of times when there is no shortage of people with extreme views who seek to set race against race and religion against religion  we are legislating in a febrile climate in which discrimination can easily flourish  and this house must take great care that nothing we do adds to that  the right response to these challenges is not to erode important rights and liberties but to do the exact opposite   to protect and champion them  given the huge backlog in the home office and its consistently poor record on initial decisions  the deport first  appeal later approach could undermine britain’s position in the world as a bastion of fair play and higher ideals  despite the evidence published by the government  i remain concerned that the threat of imprisonment to landlords who rent flat or houses to people without immigration status could lead to discrimination in the housing market  and a greater sense among black and asian young people that they are being victimised let me end on a more positive note that gives us a glimmer of hope for the bill’s onward passage to another place  i am pleased that the minister  whom labour members have time for  has conceded significant ground on immigration detention  that has had strong support from members on both sides  including the hon  member for bedford  richard fuller   who has yarl’s wood detention centre in his constituency and has long called for a more humane system 
i do agree with my hon  friend  who puts her point very well  there are obviously concerns about the case she mentions given the question of the inappropriateness of detention for children  pregnant women  and victims of rape and torture  the minister acknowledged the issue of minimising the time spent on administrative detention  and the effectiveness of administrative detention  and we are grateful for his recognition of that it is reassuring that on this issue  at least  the government have shown a willingness to listen  but that is only the start of what they need to do  they will need to do a lot more listening  particularly to their lordships  before this bill is in a fit state to reach the statute book 
way back in what seem like the mists of time   in may 2005  to be precise   i was appointed to the home office and given ministerial responsibility for the development of the european arrest warrant  and today i think back to the discussions that i used to have with the hon  member for stone  sir william cash  on that very issue  i remember that it was something of a hot potato  and i also remember that the nature of that debate changed very quickly in the aftermath of the 7 7 bombings and  subsequently  the failed bombing at shepherd’s bush on 21 july  it was found that one of the bombers  hussain osman  had taken the eurostar to paris in the immediate aftermath of that failed bombing  and had then travelled on to rome  where he was finally arrested on 29 july  a european arrest warrant was issued by the british police  and was agreed by the italian courts on 17 august  following the rejection of an appeal  osman was flown back to the united kingdom on 22 september  just two months after the failed bombing that case proved the value of the european arrest warrant  took the heat out of the political debate about it  and illustrated how the security of people here in the uk is  in fact  better served by ever closer co operation between european law enforcement agencies 
in any judicial process  there is the potential for mistakes and a miscarriage of justice  is the hon  gentleman honestly saying that he was right about the european arrest warrant all that time ago  and that it has been a bad thing and should be scrapped  if so  i think that he is in a small minority in the house  because people have seen the benefits that have come to uk law enforcement following its introduction i mentioned that case at the beginning of my speech because i see a parallel between the debate that took place then and the debate that we are having today  ten years on  as the home secretary said  we find ourselves in the aftermath of an horrific attack in one member state that was conceived and planned in another   and i note the letter that the home secretary received from minister cazeneuve encouraging our full participation in prüm in these difficult times  we   all of us in the house   have an obligation to consider every possible measure to protect the public  it seems to me that the case for greater data sharing and access to data that are held across europe is now unanswerable  and that we have an obligation to support that case  it is no exaggeration to say that our national security depends on it  that is why  as the home secretary said  the last labour government made the original decision to sign up to the prüm decisions in 2007  recognising their potential for our law enforcement agencies  it is also why  back in july 2013  we explicitly warned the government against opting out of a whole range of eu justice and home affairs measures including prüm  as i understand it  the government received warnings from other senior figures in uk law enforcement  and they should have listened to them because  as was pointed out back then  that decision seemed to be driven less by an objective assessment of the impact on crime prevention and detection  and more by a political desire to appease the never satisfied forces of euroscepticism on the conservative benches  tempting as it is to say  “we told you so” to the home secretary today  we will try and resist that and instead congratulate her on eventually arriving at the right decision and encourage her to resist the blandishments of the forces of darkness who are again rearing their head today 
the case the home secretary has just set out from the dispatch box was compelling and powerful  revealing  as it did  the zeal of the convert to the cause  she was right to make her case with such force  and i am sure my right hon  friend would agree that the problem with the amendment in the name of the hon  member for stone and others this evening is that it invites the house to prioritise the civil liberties of british citizens and risks to uk sovereignty over and above risks to national security  that is what the amendment to the motion invites us to do of course our liberties and our sovereignty are important considerations  but the safety of the public must come first  that is the primary duty of any government  and it is why the government are right not to listen to the hon  member for stone  the truth is they got themselves into difficulty two years ago by listening to those siren voices  and i hope members on the treasury bench will not make the same mistake today  indeed  i hope they would have learned an important lesson from this whole episode  it was the european council that required the government  after notification of the opt out  to conduct and publish a business and implementation case assessing the costs and benefits of prüm  in other words  the eu forced the uk government to face up to the benefits of european co operation and in bringing this motion to the house tonight they are effectively conceding the eu was right all along that assessment was informed by a pilot undertaken by the government which the home secretary referred to  it found an overwhelming case to opt back in  it involved dna samples from 2 513 unsolved british murders  rapes and burglaries which were automatically checked against european police databases in france  germany  spain and the netherlands  searching the profiles against the databases of those four member states revealed 71 scene to person matches and 47 scene to scene matches  five relating to rape  two to sexual assault and 23 to burglary 
i would put it to the hon  gentleman that security comes first and that is the primary duty of any government   to keep the public safe  once we have secured people’s safety  then liberty comes from that security  that is why i believe the amendment before the house tonight has got things the wrong way round  i conceded they are incredibly important considerations  but they are not more important than national security and any measures that enhance the security of the public here in the end contribute to enhancing their liberty  that is why security must come first as well as finding those matches  the pilot also found that information was provided in a much more timely manner than it had been under the old arrangements  as the home secretary said  it found that information was being provided in a matter of seconds  minutes or hours  drastically improving the speed and quality of investigations  at present  requests by the british police for dna checks from other european forces involve a request to the national crime agency  which is then passed to interpol before being passed on to the relevant national police force  on average  it takes 143 days for the results to come back  the benefits to uk law enforcement of opting into the prüm decisions on data access are therefore abundantly clear  in terms of speed of investigation and of resources  dna checks will be available within 15 seconds  automated number plate checks within 10 seconds and fingerprint matches within 24 hours 
i think the hon  gentleman is conflating two issues  we are not discussing that issue today  let us be clear  to avoid any misconceptions  that we are talking about the dna of people who have been convicted of a recordable crime  it seems to me that that provides sufficient safeguards against the abuse of such data  if the hon  gentleman is making an argument for the wider collection of dna  as opposed to fingerprints   the fingerprints of people entering the country are collected   that would raise other civil liberties concerns that he would have to discuss with his colleagues  he seems to be envisaging going even further than the prüm decisions  but i do not believe that we are at that point right now  perhaps he will return to that issue with his right hon  friend the home secretary in these times in which we live  the speed of investigation is essential  i invite every member of the house to cast their mind back to the hours after we heard about the paris bombings  or indeed to the hours after the shocking attacks in london a decade or so ago  people were hanging on to the news  waiting to hear of leads against those who might have committed those atrocities  that is what people want  they want the police and the security services to have  in those moments  the clearest possible line of sight across europe  so that they can pursue immediate leads and track the suspects down  that is what we need to remember when we consider these issues  we need to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to give the police and the security services  not just here but across europe  that ability to get on the trail of people who are committing atrocities against us and to track them down  in my view  the case is unanswerable  we should give them that power we should also ensure that the british police and security services have access to a much larger collection of biometric and biographical data  which will lead to more crimes here being solved and to more victims here getting the justice that they are being denied today  the earlier detection of crime and the conviction of the individuals responsible must be in the forefront of our minds 
i personally see no objection to that  but let us start within europe  let us get a clear set of standards and arrangements within europe first  i put it to the hon  gentleman that one of the benefits of the european union is that it sets a standard that the rest of the world then begins to follow  we are seeing that now with norway and iceland  in effect  they have to follow all the norms of the european union if they want to be a full trading partner  so i would not see a problem with the hon  gentleman’s suggestion  the home secretary has said that there will be many safeguards  i put it back to the hon  gentleman  would he be happy with somebody who has committed a crime going back to iceland and thus avoiding justice  i would not be happy with that and i would want measures in place to ensure that they could be brought to justice  opting in will also lead to a much better use of police time and resources  as the home secretary has said  and will improve the intelligence picture that the crime and terrorism authorities have  so that they can better understand the patterns emerging across europe 
i reiterate that security comes first  the first responsibility of any government is to secure the people who live here by taking reasonable measures to reduce the risks to them  because from that foundation of security come all our traditions  our laws and our liberties  that is why co operation in this field is a good thing  given that the nature of crime now is international  if we fail to understand that  our own legal system will never be able to respond to the changing nature of crime that we face 
why should it not  if the co operation is improved by those institutions  the hon  gentleman is putting an in built dislike and distrust of them ahead of the actual issue before us  that is what some conservative members are doing  but they should judge this on its merits  surely the better we can facilitate that co operation  the more benefits it will bring back to the police and security services  i would imagine that co operation will be enhanced by working with established institutions  as opposed to making ad hoc arrangements  government to government  that is the benefit of the european union  although i know he probably does not accept that the government have come to the right decision  albeit in a roundabout way  but i wish to press the home secretary on a few points of detail  the first of which is on the cost  she said that in the original assessment the cost of opting into prüm was put at £31 million  but she now says it is £13 million  we are prepared to accept that at face value  but can she say what is responsible for such a significant reduction in the cost  the business and implementation case says that the estimate is based on “high level requirements”  which implies that it is based not on a fully fledged implementation of prüm but just on the “high level requirements”  will she say more about that  what are the “downstream operational running costs” to which the business case refers  how much will it cost every year to run the system  set against the benefits that she said it would bring  my next point may be of interest to those who have signed the amendment  will the home secretary say what the uk will be liable to pay back to the eu if the house does not back this decision this evening  i understand that it is a significant sum  and perhaps it would help the house to know what it is i now wish to deal with the safeguards  we welcome the appointment of the oversight board  although there is concern that extradition should not be possible under a european arrest warrant purely on the basis of a dna or fingerprint match  i think this was the point that the right hon  member for orkney and shetland  mr carmichael  was raising earlier  the point was that other corroborating evidence should always be required before extradition can be granted  i think the home secretary was confirming that was the case  but it would help the house if she or one of her ministers could say a little more on that at some point 
i think the whole house will find that explanation helpful  i would share the concerns of the hon  member for stone and others if the match could then trigger a european arrest warrant immediately without any other evidence  i think everybody would find that worrying  but the right hon  lady has reassured the house on that point it is also reassuring that only people convicted of recordable crime can be searched by another police force  that still does not take away the higher level of concern that there would be over the sharing of dna profiles from named individuals  does the home secretary feel that there should be a higher proportionality test in this area  linked to more serious crime and terrorism  and does she favour a stricter test before dna information can be shared with another police force  that is an area in which a higher safeguard could be introduced  it might be effective in limiting blanket person to person searches  which bring potential for abuse who will take the decision to share personal information if a match is made  will it be a designated individual in a police force or will all decisions be taken at a national level by nca officials  it is important to be clear about who will be making these decisions  will it be an individual who makes only one or two such decisions in the course of a year  or an official who deals with many of them  i think people will have more confidence in someone who deals with a good number  because they will be able to weed out the more frivolous requests will all participating nations collect dna profiles and fingerprints from crime scenes using a shared quality assurance standard  there is concern about the lack of uniformity across europe  and people will want some reassurance on that matter  finally  will the home secretary expand on the role of the european court of justice when it comes to the prüm decision  if we choose to opt into it  as i understand it  it is quite a minor extension of its jurisdiction and there is not the fear that has been expressed by some in the motion with those caveats   i insist that they are just caveats   i conclude by saying that we on the labour benches believe that the government have reached the right decision  albeit they have done so in a roundabout way  and that they deserve our support this evening  i hope they agree that this whole issue and the way in which we have arrived at this point illustrate how our continued membership of the european union enhances the security of our country in these difficult times  the home secretary has made a convincing and powerful case tonight to rejoin the prüm decision  and she will have our support in taking an important step to catch more criminals and keep our country safe 
i have listened carefully to what the hon  gentleman said  he asked what was so special about national security that it required a european dimension  if i heard him correctly  does he agree that the fact that the paris attacks were exclusively planned in another member state answers his question 
as the home secretary has just said  people will have been sickened to see images from the latest daesh video on their television screens last night  what makes it even more disturbing are the british voices in the video and reports that one of them is a uk national who absconded to syria while on police bail for terrorism related offences  clearly  something has gone seriously wrong  people will rightly want to know how on earth this could possibly have happened and will want reassurance that steps are in hand to prevent a repeatthe home secretary has not provided that today  i do appreciate that there is a limit to what she can say  but she is only saying anything at all because we applied for an urgent question that was upgraded by the government into this statement  i believe the public are owed more than that so i want to set out the questions that she will need to answer  if not today  then over the coming days and weeks  both on the specifics and the wider implications of this case i will deal first with the case itself and the reports concerning mr siddhartha dhar  whether or not he is the person in the video does not matter  the system has failed because it allowed him to abscond to syria  and it is the system’s failings i want to focus on  rather than the identities of people in the video  he was well known to the authorities having been arrested six times on terror related offences before being placed on police bail in 2014 and asked to surrender his passport  it was when he failed to comply with those bail conditions that it emerged he had absconded  this brings me to my first question  can the home secretary tell the house when she was first made aware that this individual had absconded  did she order an inquiry at that time  and if she did  can she tell us what it revealed and what immediate action she took to tighten up procedures  if she did not order a review  can she say why she did not do so  was he placed on a watch list and  if so  when  if not  why not at the heart of this case is the system of police bail for people arrested for terrorism related activity and whether it offers the potential for loopholes  can thehome secretary tell the house whether the authorities followed the correct procedures between arrest and the bail hearing even if the correct procedures were followed  i have evidence that they were far too weak  i have here the letter sent to dhar setting out his bail conditions after he was bailed on 26 september 2014  it reminds him that he was due to surrender his travel documents by 3 october 2014  but this letter was sent over a month later  on 7 november  let me quote from the letter  it states  “it has come to our notice that condition number 3 has not been complied with  or so our records suggest  are there any changes to your circumstances that the police need to be aware of  could you please contact the police on the telephone number listed above as a matter of urgency ” does that in any way sound like an adequate response to the seriousness of the charges  it is clear that mr dhar had left this country long before that letter was sent  as i have said  regardless of which individuals might be in the video  this particular individual has absconded and the home secretary needs to provide answers i turn now to the wider implications of this episode  will the home secretary tell the house how many other individuals are currently on bail for terror related offences  is she satisfied that their bail conditions and the monitoring of those individuals are adequate  is this the only example of an individual absconding while on police bail  or are there others  on the question of the passport  can she say whether  in cases of this type  the authorities should seize a passport immediately rather than waiting for it to be surrendered voluntarily will the home secretary also tell us whether individuals in terrorism related cases should immediately be placed on the watch list for all airports and seaports at the point of arrest  there are also wider implications about border checks  and anecdotal reports suggest that people continue to be waved through at seaports  the government committed to check all passports on exit from the uk by the end of the last parliament  has that been implemented  if every passport is not currently checked  when will the figure reach 100   even if mr dhar’s passport was not checked here  it should have been checked on arrival in the schengen area  however  at the time he went through the border  the uk was not party to the schengen information system  which allows the sharing of our watch lists across europe  because the home secretary had delayed our participation in it  in retrospect  does she now accept that that delay was a mistake and that it weakened our security arrangements  can she confirm that we are now playing our full part we know that the border force has undergone a huge upheaval since 2010  involving losing staff  and that it is today facing further cuts  does the home secretary believe that the numbers of border staff are adequate to the meet the threat level and that further cuts will not leave us exposed in conclusion  we appreciate that this is an ongoing police investigation  but the fact that this individual could abscond while facing major charges raises serious questions about counter terrorism policy  we need a commitment from the home secretary today that there will be an inquiry into this episode and that its findings will be made available to the house  there has clearly been a major lapse in security  and the onus now is very firmly on the home secretary to demonstrate that she is taking all the necessary action to strengthen our systems of monitoring people who pose a risk to our country 
i have listened very carefully to the hon  gentleman  he has said that in 2011 the government made a policy decision to accelerate and that they failed to communicate the effects of that decision to the many people affected  why does he therefore conclude that the government do not have a moral obligation to put that mistake right 
i shall take the home secretary back to a question she was asked several times last week but refused to answer  in late 2014  a terror suspect from east london well known to the uk security services skipped police bail and walked freely out of the uk to syria via dover  let me try again  when was she first informed that this individual had absconded and were any checks made on his passport before he left 
that is not good enough  the public are concerned about this and deserve answers  a uk terror suspect broke police bail and walked out of this country unchecked  but it gets worse  yesterday  it was reported that the mastermind behind the paris attacks last year freely entered this country  through dover again  despite being known to the authorities in europe  is this true  and were any checks made on this individual on his arrival in the uk 
two straight questions  no answers  on matters as serious as this  that is simply not good enough  terror suspects are freely walking in and out of the united kingdom on this home secretary’s watch  terror suspects know the sea border is a weak link  partly because she delayed uk involvement in the schengen information system  which would have given the uk access to eu security checks  the british public need answers  not ministers hiding behind excuses  will she today order an urgent review of our border security at our ferry terminals and of the police bail regime for terror suspects 
as the home secretary said  this is one of the most shocking and disturbing reports ever presented to parliament  it confirms that the russian state  at its highest level  sanctioned the killing of a british citizen on the streets of our capital city and  in so doing  exposed thousands of londoners to unacceptable levels of risk   an unparalleled act of state sponsored terrorism that must meet with a commensurate response  so far reaching are the implications of the report that it is important not to rush to judgment today  time must be taken to digest its findings and consider our response  there are difficult questions that need to be asked in formulating that response  and i intend to focus on those first  however  i echo the home secretary’s words of praise for sir robert owen and his inquiry team  without whose painstaking work this important truth would not be known  i also extend the gratitude of labour members to the metropolitan police service for what the report calls an “exemplary investigation” and to the litvinenko family’s legal team  particularly ben emmerson  who supported them on a pro bono basis  and probably without whom we would not be here today more importantly  i am sure the whole house will join me in sending a message of admiration  sympathy and solidarity to marina and anatoly litvinenko  who have fought so courageously to make this day a reality  people will of course leap to the international and diplomatic issues that arise  but it must be remembered  first and foremost  that this was a family tragedy  and their wishes surely matter most  with that in mind  would the home secretary be prepared to meet marina and anatoly to discuss this report  its findings  and the british government’s response  i have spoken to marina  and i know that she would welcome that let me now turn to that government response  i welcome what the home secretary said about renewing efforts to bring the murderers to justice  and her new approach to nato and eu allies  however  given that these two individuals are reported to be travelling  will she go further and directly approach all eu  nato and commonwealth allies individually to ask for their immediate co operation on extradition there may be other individuals who are british citizens and who are facing similar dangers  will the home secretary provide assurances that there will be a review of the security of those most at risk  has she reviewed the level of security that was provided to mr litvinenko by the british security services  and can any lessons be drawn from this in better protecting others  that is important  because there is a real possibility that this was not an isolated incident  the house may be aware of an ongoing inquest into the death of alexander perepilichny  a prominent russian lawyer who dropped dead in surrey after going for run  while there is a limit on what we can say about an ongoing inquest  does the home secretary believe that there is a case for it to be upgraded and provided with extra support  possibly from sir robert himself i will now turn to potential action against the wider network of russian interests linked to the perpetrators  of course  no individuals commit these crimes alone  and today’s report confirms that there is a network of people who will have known about and facilitated this crime  i gather that mrs litvinenko has prepared a list of names  to be submitted today to the government  of people who have aided and abetted the perpetrators  and against whom she believes sanctions should be taken  this could include the freezing of uk assets and property and travel restrictions  will the home secretary give an in principle commitment to look seriously at that list and those requests  further  can she say whether  going forward  action of this kind would be facilitated by new legislation along the lines of the magnitsky law in the us  and whether the government are giving any consideration to that finally  let me turn to our wider relationship with russia  the home secretary indicated that there will be new diplomatic pressure  and i welcome that  but i have to say  having listened carefully to her  that i am not sure that it goes anywhere near far enough in answering the seriousness of the findings in this report  indeed  it could send a dangerous signal to russia that our response is too weak  what has been announced today cannot be the end of what the british government are prepared to do given what we know about the way the russian state operates  is there not a case for a wide ranging review of the nature and extent of this country’s relations with it   diplomatic  political  economic  and cultural  given the proven fsb involvement  will the government consider expelling all fsb officers from britain immediately  more broadly  can the home secretary say whether the prime minister has ever raised this case directly with vladimir putin  and whether he is seeking an urgent conversation with him today to discuss the findings of this report on parliamentary matters  it beggars belief that one of the suspected murderers is today a leading member of the duma and even second in command of its security committee  given that fact   this may be a question for you  mr speaker   what is the correct relationship for this parliament to have with its russian counterpart on cultural collaboration  given what the report reveals about the russian government and their links to organised crime  and given what we know about corruption in fifa  is there not a growing case for this country to engage with others in a debate about whether the 2018 world cup should go ahead in russia  on the economy  are the government satisfied that the current eu sanctions against russia are adequate  and is there a case to strengthen them i ask those questions not because i have come to a conclusion about them  but because i believe they are the difficult but right questions that fall out of the report and that this country now needs to debate them in the light of its findings  if we are to do justice to the litvinenko family there is a question about how the government go about formulating their response and the considerations that will guide them  although the home secretary ordered this review  it is important to note that she originally refused to do so  citing international issues  she has mentioned them again today  but should not it be considerations of justice  not diplomacy  that lead the government’s response  will she give a categorical assurance to that effect  there can be no sense of the government pulling their punches because of wider diplomatic considerations  if we were to do that  would it not send a terrible message to the world that britain is prepared to tolerate outrageous acts of state violence on its soil and appease those who sanctioned them once all those considerations are complete  will the home secretary commit to coming back to this house and updating it on the final package of steps that the government will take  the litvinenko family deserve nothing less after their courageous fight i wish to finish by recalling alexander litvinenko’s last words to his son  anatoly  who was then 12 years old  he said “defend britain to your last drop  because it has saved your family ”he believed in britain and its tradition of justice and fairness  standing up to the mighty and for what is right  should not we now find the courage to show his son and the world that his father’s faith in us was not misplaced 
the thought of any child alone in a foreign country is abhorrent to any parent  but for them to be alone in dangerous conditions   without food  warmth  comfort or protection   is genuinely terrifying  sadly  that is the reality today for thousands of syrian children and those fleeing other conflicts  the truth is that some of these frightened young souls are on our own doorstep  as my right hon  friend the leader of the opposition saw for himself at the weekend  no child should be left to fend for themselves  whoever they are and wherever they are  i have no doubt that  when faced with this issue  the vast majority of british people would see a moral duty to act  as the right hon  member for brentwood and ongar  sir eric pickles  has just said i congratulate my right hon  friend the member for normanton  pontefract and castleford  yvette cooper  on asking the question and welcome the minister’s commitment to look seriously at the issue  but may i press him on some of the points that my right hon  friend made  in particular  will he consider children who are here in europe  as well as those who are in the camps  the government’s policy to date has been to take only refugees from the region  rather than those who have crossed the sea  does he not accept that  as the crisis develops  that distinction is becoming harder to maintain there are 26 000 unaccompanied children in europe today  they cannot  as the government claim  be described as the fittest and the strongest  they are instead highly vulnerable to trafficking  prostitution and other forms of abuse  they urgently need someone to reach out a hand  i appreciate the concern that doing so could create an unhelpful precedent and an incentive for families to send children alone  but surely that can be dealt with by making it clear that this is an exceptional move and by working with the unhcr and others to identify children who are genuinely alone this is the biggest humanitarian crisis since the second world war  but instead of playing our full part  the prime minister has spent recent weeks stomping around europe with his own list of demands  does the minister not accept that  to countries that are trying to deal with the enormity of this crisis  that might make us look a little selfish and blinkered  by doing more to help our partners in europe  might not the prime minister build good will and get a better hearing for his renegotiation demands as others have said  this week we will remember the awful events of the holocaust and the kindertransport  surely now is the time to take inspiration from those british heroes of the last century and act to change the course of history in this 
will the hon  gentleman give way 
will the minister give way 
i am grateful to the minister  but let us get something straight  when i became shadow home secretary  he and his government colleagues were proposing to cut police funding by between 25  and 40   it was pressure from labour members  led by my hon  friend the member for birmingham  erdington  jack dromey  in a full opposition day debate  that forced them into a humiliating u turn  let us just get our facts right anyway  is this promise what it seems to be  the minister seems to be suggesting that there will be no cuts  but can he guarantee that there will be no real terms cut for any police force in the next few years 
answer the question 
rose   
i am glad to hear it  because i never did think that the minister was in that category  he is saying a few things that are worrying me  he stood there a few moments ago and said that there were to be no real terms cuts to the police  that is simply untrue and i hope that he will correct the record before this debate ends  the other thing he just said was that there were more officers in front line positions  a workforce survey that came out last week showed that his government cut police officers by 18 000 in the last parliament  is he seriously standing there today and saying that  despite that cut of 18 000  there are more police officers on our streets 
may i commend the home secretary for her announcement this weekend and for her decision to put the national interest before self interest  unlike others  when she began as home secretary  she took a eurosceptic stance  opting out of dozens of eu measures  but she has since opted back in to many   most recently  on the sharing of fingerprinting and dna  is it fair to say that the realities of office have shown her the value of eu co operation in tackling crime and terrorism  and changed her mind on britain’s membership of the eu 
i think i will take that as a yes  yesterday  on the “the andrew marr show”  the prime minister was explicitly clear that our membership of the eu helps britain fight terrorism  but within minutes he was directly contradicted by one of his own cabinet ministers  who claimed the uk’s eu membership made a paris style attack here more likely  this would be bad coming from ukip  but coming from one of our most senior members of the cabinet  it is downright irresponsible  will the home secretary take this opportunity to reaffirm government policy on this crucial issue and condemn this baseless scaremongering 
i beg to move that this house recalls that the chancellor announced in the autumn statement 2015 that there would be real terms protection for police funding  notes that  based on the scale of cuts proposed  police budgets will fall by between nine and ten per cent over four years in real terms  further notes that the failure to provide real terms protection for the police budget will lead to further cuts in police numbers in addition to the 18 357 police officers already lost since 2010  notes that the inclusion of cybercrime in crime statistics will show that crime has doubled  notes the heightened threat of a terrorist attack in the uk and the operational role of neighbourhood police in preventing such an attack  and calls on the government to honour the chancellor’s statement to the house and provide real terms protection for the police budget we called this debate for one simple reason  the public have not been told the truth about police funding or crime figures  with the second police and crime commissioner elections just weeks away  people need the facts so this evening we set the record straight a matter of weeks ago the chancellor of the exchequer stood at the dispatch box and made this explicit promise to the police and to the public “there will be real terms protection for police funding  the police protect us  and we are going to protect the police ”     official report  25 november 2015  vol  602  c  1373  i am sure conservative members remember that because they waved their order papers  it could not have been clearer   “real terms protection”  that was not an off the cuff remark or a slip of the tongue  it was the centrepiece announcement of the chancellor’s autumn spending review statement  made with the home secretary and the prime minister at his side  it was the traditional rabbit out of the hat that we have come to expect on such occasions  designed to produce mass waving of order papers there was once a time when  if the chancellor of the exchequer made a statement of that kind in that way to this house  it would have meant something more than just a grab for the next day’s headlines  people could trust it to be true  because it had been said by a chancellor of the exchequer at the dispatch box in the house of commons  but it seems that we live in different times  ministers these days  from the prime minister downwards  are decidedly less attentive than they used to be to the veracity of what they say at the dispatch box  every member of this house should worry  because in the end it goes to the heart of trust in this place and what we all do surely  of all public services  the police should be able to trust the word of ministers of the crown when commitments are given here  would it not be a sign of disrespect to people who put themselves in harm’s way on our behalf day in  day out if the chancellor was writing cheques that he knew he would not be able to cash  you would think so  wouldn’t you  but in today’s politics ministers think they can say what they like and get away with it this evening i will present to the house new analysis which shows that the chancellor has broken his promise to the police and to the public  he has failed to provide real terms protection for police budgets in 2016 17  in fact  he is about to cut those police budgets yet again  for the sixth year in a row  for the six years that he has been chancellor and the six years that the right hon  member for maidenhead  mrs may  has been home secretary  we have had six years of cuts to the police  what a record  and to think that the conservatives used to call themselves the party of law and order the issue before the house tonight is this  are we prepared to let the government think that they can get away with making promises to this house and then breaking them within days  or are we going to do something about it  are we going to hold them to account and make them honour the promise they made to our local police forces 
i was just about to make that very point  the cuts that we are now facing come on top of the loss of 18 000 police officers over the previous parliament  as my right hon  friend has just said  and 12 000 of them were front line officers  thousands of police community support officers and civilian staff have lost their jobs  we have begun to see the break up of neighbourhood policing  which was a great achievement of the previous labour government  bringing police out of their stations and cars and back into communities  restoring trust and bringing down crime  that is a record that labour should be proud of 
the same story is repeated all over the country  i ask my hon  friend to think about the cuts that have been made to other services alongside the police  such as those to councils  mental health services  social care  disability benefits  ambulance services and fire services  all those cuts pile extra pressure on our overstretched police forces  that is what we are seeing  the cuts now being planned come at a time when this country is facing multiple challenges on many fronts  and when the threat level has never been higher  so something has to give 
i think that people will hear what my hon  friend has said and make their own judgment  who protects community safety  who stands up for the police  when people come to vote this may  there is the evidence that when labour is in government  when we run councils and when we have labour police and crime commissioners  we protect front line and neighbourhood policing and we improve community safety  my hon  friend makes that point very well the question we have to ask the home secretary today is this  how many more consecutive years of cuts can police forces take before public safety is seriously compromised  england and wales already have far fewer police officers per head of population compared with international counterparts  if the ratio drops even lower  there are real fears that were a paris style attack to happen here  and  importantly  were it to happen outside london  there would simply not be the ability to surge enough police officers   specifically  fire arms officers and specialist units   on to the streets quickly enough to protect the public 
i will come on to both points  i am doing fine  thanks  i hope that the hon  gentleman can see that i will be standing up for police forces  even if he is not  i will come on to both points he raises  because i do not think that his government are telling the correct story about what they are doing to the police  they are not providing real terms protection  they are cutting the police  ministers also stand at the dispatch box and say crime is falling  the policing minister said it just days ago   complacently  they fail to point out that the crime figures they quote do not include online crime  which is about to come into the crime statistics for the first time  in the last six years  crime has changed   it has moved online   but the relevant figures have not been counted  so i would not be so complacent if i were him the hon  gentleman mentioned what was said at the autumn statement about what i was meant to have said  what i would say to him is that there is far too much spin coming from the government dispatch box  he should look at what i actually said  i am about to come straight to that issue i have talked about the specialist and firearms units we need to protect the public  however  neighbourhood policing is crucial  is it not  if we are to collect the intelligence to combat the terror threat  my worry is that if the government proceed in this parliament with year on year cuts  they will break up the neighbourhood teams  let me take the house in detail through what i am saying and through the figures we are presenting analysis by the house of commons library of next year’s police grant settlement to individual forces shows that they will not be protected in real terms  in fact  they will not even be cash protected  in 2015 16  the overall allocation to individual forces  excluding special payments to london  was £7 452 million  in 2016 17  it will be £7 421 million   a £30 million cash reduction  or £160 million in real terms 
i can tell the hon  gentleman now that the leader of the opposition said that that was simply not the case  there is no change whatever to long established policy when it comes to the police keeping the public safe 
the government are cutting the police at national level  making local people in the west midlands   and in greater manchester too   pick up the bill  but people are getting less in terms of police on their streets  we know  do we not  that the government are very good at making cuts in urban areas such as greater manchester and the west midlands and at taking money elsewhere  that is the reality  our constituents will be paying more for less  the chancellor and the home secretary have broken their police promise to our constituents 
i will come to that as well  the bill we will debate in a week or so is all about having a part time police force to deal with the growing threat we face from online crime and fraud and from terror  that is simply not an answer to the challenges of the future  and i will come to that before i finish 
i will make a little more progress  and then i will give way to my hon  friend let us just get the facts on the record  36 of the 43 police forces in england and wales have now received their grant allocations from the home office  and these show a cut in cash terms  how does that deliver the chancellor’s pledge of real terms protection  worse  all police forces in england face real terms cuts next year  if the same level of cuts is sustained over the spending review period  as we suspect it will be  that will equate to overall real terms cuts in the police budget of between 9  and 10  the house will recall that right up until the spending review     interruption   i am coming to the point  right up until the spending review  the police had been told to expect cuts of over 20   senior police officers say that they were still expecting cuts of over 20  the day before the spending review settlement  the hon  member for north west hampshire  kit malthouse  nods because he knows i am right about that  it was sustained pressure from labour members that forced a rethink from the government 
i will give way to the home secretary in a moment after the paris attacks  the whole question of police funding had to be looked at in a new light  i wrote to the home secretary and said that while of course efficiencies could be made  anything over 5  cuts in real terms over the course of this parliament would be dangerous  that was completely misrepresented by the chancellor in his autumn statement  and i am pleased to correct the record today 
when that press release was issued i said that up to 5  would be do able     interruption   no  i have said this consistently  if the home secretary will just listen  i said that up to 5  cuts would be doable  and we stand by that  that up to 10  would be difficult  and that over 10  would be dangerous  she was threatening to cut the police by over 20   so let us get the facts straight  she will recall that she asked cobra to review police funding in the light of the paris attacks  my hon  friend the member for birmingham  erdington  jack dromey    the shadow policing minister   and i also consulted the police in the light of the paris attacks  we listened to what they had to say  as the home secretary will have done  they said that over 5  would be difficult  if not dangerous  and i put that in a letter to her before the autumn statement  let us get this right so that the public are not misinformed and there is no spin from the government dispatch box in his desperation to play politics in the autumn statement  the chancellor tried to misrepresent my position  but he outdid himself  because he misrepresented not just my position but the government’s position  he dressed up a 10  cut as budget protection  and we now know that it is nothing of the sort  no doubt the government’s defence will rest on the claim that they gave councils extra freedom to increase the police precept to make up the shortfall  but that does not hold water  for the chancellor to give the guarantee in this house as he did  he would have needed firm agreements from local councils and pccs that they would raise the extra cash locally  but he did not have those agreements   not even from conservative pccs  the devon and cornwall and cambridgeshire forces will not be raising their precepts by the full amount recommended by the government  and hertfordshire is actually shown to have lowered its precept   interruption  the home secretary says  “it’s their decision”  but let me tell her again  she promised real terms protection for police budgets  and she is not delivering real terms protection for police budgets  she has broken her promise to the police  i am afraid that she cannot just shrug that fact off  the conservative pcc for devon and cornwall  tony hogg  says this about the implications of the spending review for his force “while i completely welcome the government’s changed position on police funding  it remains a fact that central government funding to devon and cornwall police in 2020 is estimated to be 19  less in cash terms  real terms 32  less  than it was when i commenced office in november 2012 ”a 32  cut in real terms  with 43 officers going next year and 28 police staff going too  is not on  and the government cannot just shrug it off the next claim that the government will no doubt make is that authorities that have used the precept freedoms to the full will have been able to protect their budgets  but that is not true either  the hampshire independent pcc  simon hayes  said “the medium term financial strategy   shows an estimated budget shortfall of £6m by 2019 20 assuming 1 99  council tax precept increases from 2016 17 onwards ”he cannot make up the shortfall from his precept let me apply the same test to the home secretary’s police force and my own  next year  thames valley police will see a real terms cut in central government funding of £5 million  the income raised by the full use of the precept does not cover that shortfall  forces such as thames valley also have to contend with other cost burdens loaded on to them by the chancellor  including the apprenticeship levy and the extra national insurance contributions  in the case of thames valley  those amount to more than £6 million  that is money out of front line policing  what is the net effect of that in the home secretary’s police force  she should listen to this  95 officers going next year  as well as 51 police community support officers and 161 staff  there we have it  the home secretary has broken her own police pledge to her constituents let us look at my force  greater manchester police  according to figures from the library  central government funding will be down by £8 million in real terms next year  the force has made full use of the freedoms from the precept  but that will not make up the shortfall  as my hon  friend the member for birmingham  selly oak  steve mccabe  said  the force will be paying more for less  as the pcc for greater manchester  tony lloyd  puts it “contrary to the chancellor’s rhetoric  this is a cuts budget ”
my hon  friend is absolutely right  the more deprived parts of the country have less ability to raise money from their council tax base  so they cannot make up for the government’s cuts  i am sorry to tell her that the situation could be about to get even worse  the guardian reported yesterday that the home secretary is about to bring forward a new police funding formula   after the mess that the policing minister made of the last one   which will divert funding away from urban forces towards rural ones 
the home secretary is shaking her head  and i am glad  i hope that she will tell me that that is not true  recently  £300 million was miraculously made available for local government in england at the last minute  but   surprise  surprise   barely a penny went to any council represented by labour  it all went to councils represented by the conservatives  if the police funding formula did the same  it would add insult to injury and make a complete and utter mockery of the government’s already dubious commitment to creating a northern powerhouse 
i could not have put it better myself  vote labour  vote for a labour pcc  labour pccs will work cleverly to protect front line policing  and they will drive innovation and reform  protect our police by voting labour in may  i thank the hon  gentleman for making my point better than i could have done 
i think it would be wrong  and i am very worried about the proposal to put fire under the control of the pccs  because fire will be the poor relation  already  thousands of firefighters  fire pumps and fire stations are at risk from the local government settlement  i put it to the hon  gentleman and all conservative members that considering the cuts to the police  and to the fire service as well  we must all ask ourselves the question  is there adequate emergency cover in all parts of the country  i believe we are getting to the point at which some people will say that that is no longer the case  we need to look at those two things together  putting two underfunded services together will not necessarily create a financially viable or safe service i want to move on to the crime figures  because i am conscious of the time  the government’s alibi for their police cuts so far has been that it is okay to cut the police because crime is falling  that is basically the argument made by the hon  member for north west hampshire  who formerly had responsibility for policing in london    but is it true  the latest recorded crime statistics in january showed large increases in violent crime  knife crime  hate crime and sexual offences as ever  ministers will say  “look at the british crime survey ” but as i have said  crime has changed  it has migrated online  we might see a downward trend in the traditional volume crimes such as burglary and theft in the british crime survey  but when we ask the british public whether they have been the victim of online crime  they will probably say  “yes  i have been ” if those figures are not included in the british crime survey  it is no wonder that we do not have an accurate picture of crime 
i will give way one final time 
what we should not do is to throw volunteers at it  which is the home secretary’s idea    interruption   i will come on to explain that  this is about both technology and people  we need sophisticated teams to deal with it  it is fair to say that most police forces do not have such a capability at the moment  and they will not get that capability by having their numbers and their budgets cut  we need a sophisticated response to online crime 
that is directly the effect of what the government have done  compared with what they inherited  how on earth can that police force now develop the capability to deal with the threats we will face in the future  the argument that crime is falling so we can cut the police will not work any more  ministers are going to have to get a new script  it is not safe to cut the police  because crime is becoming more complex 
no  i will not  because  as my hon  friend the member for birmingham  erdington said  the figures were accurately reported  the challenge today is for the home secretary to explain her claim that crime is falling  because i am afraid the recorded crime figures do not show that  and some experts say that the british crime survey is about to show that crime has in fact doubled  that is the issue that she has to explain  and she will have to work hard to do so tackling online crime is one of the biggest challenges we face  but as i have said  forces do not have the capability  the question is  how are they going to do that with these further cuts  to be fair  the home secretary has floated one idea  which i have just mentioned  she told the bbc website in january that she was planning to recruit a new army of volunteers to help solve cybercrimes  she said that“volunteers who specialise in accountancy or computing” as well as it professionals “could work alongside police officers to investigate cyber or financial crime” i ask in all honesty  is that really the best the government can come up with to crack the complex crime challenges of the future   theresa’s temps  a dad’s army of retired accountants to take on and defeat the sophisticated international organised crime and fraud networks the week after next  we will debate the home secretary’s bill  which will propose that powers be given to volunteers without their becoming special constables  is that really the answer   a part time police force  it does not equate to a vision for policing in england and wales that is up to the challenges of the future  a part time police force is no answer to the growing threats we face from cybercrime and terrorism  when it is the only answer that the government can come up with  it is a sure sign that their cuts have gone way too far 
we have seen this cost cutting and privatisation elsewhere  haven’t we  take nhs 111  which was going to solve everything because of the algorithms that the call handlers would use  has the service to the public been better than under nhs direct  in no way  my hon  friend has got it absolutely right  the government suggest that it can all be done on the cheap  but people know it cannot in conclusion  the official line from the government has been  “we’re protecting the police and crime is falling ” but that claim is something that should be added to the growing fraud statistics  the truth is the opposite  the police are being cut while crime is rising  they are cutting the fire service and the border force even more deeply   tory cuts that are putting people’s safety at risk  that is the message that we will take into the pcc elections  our police do a difficult job in a dangerous world  they deserve our thanks and respect  particularly those of the government of the day  if promises are made to them  they should be kept  as we have shown  labour is prepared to stand up for the police and protect community safety  that is what we are asking the house to do tonight by making this arrogant government honour their commitment to the police  real terms protection should mean just that  what better way is there for members on both sides of the house to show their appreciation for their local police forces than by voting for the opposition motion tonight 
i am listening carefully to what the home secretary is saying and she has repeated the claim that she is protecting the police in real terms  is she therefore denying the figures from the house of commons library that show 36 out of 43 police forces in england and wales receiving cash cuts in their allocation from the home office for 2016 17 
i thank the home secretary for giving way one more time  because this is an important debate and people need the truth  they will have heard that she did not answer my last question about home office cash cuts to 36 police forces  so let me ask another question  she loves to read out what i said   5   10    but i have already gone through what i said and the letter i wrote to her  let us get the facts straight  why did david jamieson put forward those plans  it was because until the day before the spending review  the home secretary was telling the police that they could expect 25  cuts  that is what she was telling them  that is what they were planning for  what happened to make her change her mind the day before the spending review  and back down on the 25  cuts that she was planning 
rose   
i am very grateful to the home secretary  she has just said something that goes to the heart of our debate today  she said that the government had protected police budgets in real terms  once the police precept is taken into account   she said something along those lines  will she accept that that caveat was not in the chancellor’s autumn statement 
the hon  gentleman has mentioned the met he inherited in 2008  i would not argue that it was perfect  but does he accept that the metropolitan police of 2008 were a universe away from the metropolitan police of 1997  who failed properly to investigate the murder of stephen lawrence 
rose   
will the secretary of state give way 
i am grateful to the secretary of state for giving way  and i appreciate that she is coming to a close  she began her speech by saying that crime had fallen  and it is important that we have clarity on that point  i draw her attention to an exchange between the policing minister and my hon  friend the member for rotherham  sarah champion  last week  my hon  friend asked the minister whether crime would spike when online crime was added to the statistics  the minister said “the national audit office suggested that that would be the case  and we have to accept that ”     official report  1 march 2016  vol  606  c  917  was the minister right to say that  and will crime go up when those figures are added 
the opposition welcome most of the measures in the bill  indeed  we have led calls for some of them over many years  in the last parliament  i am proud to say that the shadow health team  and in particular my hon  friend the member for liverpool  wavertree  luciana berger   raised public awareness of the growing practice of holding in police cells people who are in mental health crisis  we congratulate the home secretary on acting to outlaw that practice  and she will have our full support in doing so the home secretary will also have our full support on measures in the bill to do with firearms  as she has just explained  alcohol licensing and child sexual exploitation  however  i urge the government to read what my hon  friend the member for rotherham  sarah champion  has said about the action plan that was published a year ago  she pointed out that there has not been sufficient progress on a number of points within it  i encourage the government to take action quickly  in other areas  such as the reform of police complaints  accountability and police bail  we have long called for change and  encouragingly  there now appears to be consensus for it  however  we do not think that the government have gone far enough  as i will come on to explain  we will press for changes in those areas to strengthen the bill 
that is an interesting proposal  but it is the view of the labour party in wales  it is not yet the view of the party at uk level  but we will give it serious consideration let me be clear  welcome as many of the measures are  the bill falls short of providing what our emergency services need  it does not add up to a convincing vision for the reform of emergency services that is equal to the scale of future challenges or the threat we face as a country  right now  our police and fire services are halfway through a decade of real terms cuts  the home secretary began by claiming that her record was one of reform  the reform we are seeing is in fact the demise of the successful neighbourhood policing model that she inherited from the previous government  she has presided over worryingly low morale across police and fire services  as is also the case   on the health secretary’s part   in the ambulance service  that low morale needs to be addressed 
my hon  friend makes precisely the point i was coming on to make  whatever ministers claim  36 of the 43 police forces face cash cuts in the coming year  while all of them face real terms cuts  as he has said  west midlands police will lose £10 million in real terms   the precept does not cover that   and my own greater manchester police will lose £8 million  at the same time  he needs to consider the cuts to fire services  because west midlands fire service will have a cut of 45  in its budget over the decade  in effect  the budget will halve  and the same is also true for greater manchester    interruption   it is true  ministers seem not to know that fire services are being cut in half  i put it to the home secretary and her police and fire services minister that that prompts this question  can they be sure that their cuts to police and fire services are not exposing our big cities to unacceptable levels of risk  what assessment have they made of their capability to deal with a major incident or a paris style attack  experts in the fire and rescue service would argue that their cuts have already gone too far 
i do not think that the hon  gentleman can have been paying attention  we have just had an exchange in which the home secretary acknowledged that online crime is about to be added to the crime figures  as he may know from his constituency postbag  crime has changed in recent years  we have seen reductions in traditional volume crime   burglary  car crime   and crime has moved online  when ministers stand at the dispatch box and complacently say that crime has fallen  i am afraid that they are not representing the real picture  the real picture will look very different when the figures are published in a couple of months’ time 
there is a simple answer  because the current practice was recommended by the independent office for national statistics  the home secretary may want to take credit for everything  but i am afraid that she cannot do so  it was independently recommended  and just as the previous labour government accepted statisticians’ independent recommendations  so must she  the picture will soon look very different  and i caution her against the complacent statement  which she made again today  that crime has fallen  crime has changed  and the figures will soon show that crime has in fact doubled 
i agree with the hon  gentleman that cybercrime or online crime is one of the biggest challenges that we face  but there would probably be agreement across the floor of the house that  among the 43 police forces in england and wales  there is not yet the capability to investigate cybercrime  that is an issue for everybody  my question is how those forces will develop that capability if they face year upon year of real terms cuts  i just do not think that that is sustainable the hon  gentleman must also think about public safety and the cuts to fire services  there are cuts to the fire service in london and thousands of the number of firefighters  pumps and stations is being cut all over the country  thousands more are set to go following a local government settlement that has inflicted the biggest cuts on urban areas  the embarrassing truth for ministers is that if their northern powerhouse catches fire  there will be no one there to put it out 
again  i urge government members not to be so complacent  the hon  gentleman may have seen that there was a fire in north london  around euston  in the last couple of weeks where the london fire brigade missed its response target and  sadly  there was a fatality  i would not be so complacent if i were him  because fire services up and down the country are missing their recommended response times  if he believes that the cuts to london’s fire brigade and to fire and rescue services around the country can carry on in the way that his party proposes  i think he is putting public safety at serious risk the government’s answer to the funding challenges is to have greater collaboration and greater use of volunteers  neither is wrong in principle  the question is how they will be implemented  there are risks inherent in both policies if they are done in the wrong way  together  they do not add up to a convincing solution for the future of emergency services  patching two leaky buckets together does not make one that works  as the police and crime commissioner for northumbria  vera baird  said today  the bill looks suspiciously like a plan for “policing on the cheap” 
what i have heard from my fire services in the north west is that they did not have enough resources to cope  greater manchester fire services were drawn up to cumbria when the bad weather hit  but when the flooding came down to greater manchester  they did not have enough resources to cover it  we heard at christmas about a hastily concocted plan to cut the incident response units  which are there to deal with a dirty bomb  these cuts are going too far  the question the government have to answer is simple  can they give us a guarantee that there are enough fire and police resources in place to ensure that if a major incident or paris style attack were to happen in one of our big cities  public safety would not be compromised  i do not believe that they have answered that question and  until they do  i will keep on asking it as i was saying  the bill looks like a plan for policing on the cheap  i will come back to part 1 later  but first i will go through the measures that we support part 2 deals with police accountability  although there has been progress in that area  i think it would be accepted on both sides of the house that there is much further to go  ongoing historical cases such as hillsborough  orgreave  and the daniel morgan murder  stand as testimony to the uphill struggle that ordinary people face in holding the police to account  even when there is clear evidence of wrongdoing  as the home secretary said  there is no sign that public confidence has improved  given that so many people who are dissatisfied choose not to pursue their complaint there is also evidence that the current system is not as fair as it should be to police officers who face disciplinary charges  with professional standards branches encouraged to adopt a heavy handed approach  we agree with the government that the system for handling complaints is in need of serious reform  and we welcome clarification that all complaints should be recorded  ending the confusion that comes with leaving that decision up to police officers  i give a cautious welcome to the new role for police and crime commissioners in that area  but it is still early days for pccs  and many have yet to show that they can effectively hold a whole police force to account  an individual who is close to the force on operational matters may struggle to hold it to account on disciplinary matters  that is an open question  and the government should not have too much trust that that will materialise 
i will come to that point in a moment  but i agree with my hon  friend and i will demonstrate why his point is entirely valid we support measures in the bill to refocus and rename the ipcc  and to strengthen its independence by allowing it to initiate its own investigations and carry them out directly  rather than relying on police forces  we also support protections for whistleblowers  and potentially the most powerful proposal in the bill is the power to bring super complaints i recently held a seminar with baroness doreen lawrence  which brought together groups that are still campaigning for justice  such as the shrewsbury 24 campaign  the orgreave truth and justice campaign  and justice 4 daniel  there are common threads between them all  but the way the system works currently forces them all to plough their own furrow individually  and it does not allow them to join forces  the super complaint proposal could rebalance the system in their favour  which is why i welcome it so strongly i know that the home secretary has still to publish details on how that proposal will work  but i offer to work with her and i encourage her to allow a number of often small campaign groups to bring a complaint together  for instance  if the stephen lawrence campaign had been able to join forces with the daniel morgan campaign  or if the orgreave campaign had been able to join forces with the hillsborough families  history could have been very different  at our seminar we heard from all campaigns about something that they hold in common  the unacceptable levels of collusion between the police and the press  if the government fail to honour the police’s promise to victims of phone hacking and to set up the second leveson inquiry   as we have been led to believe from reports   i hope that the route of the super complaint will open up another avenue for campaigners 
i have been very clear about that  with the election things have changed  and we do not oppose police and crime commissioners  i am prepared to give them a chance and i believe in stronger accountability for the police  i did say   i stand by this   that it is hard for one individual  albeit an elected individual  to hold the weight and might of an entire police force to account  particularly when that person is also dealing with operational matters  that is a stretch  and i do not think that the office of pcc has yet shown itself able to do that  i would prefer to build on the model of the pcc and broaden it out  perhaps more to a london style model where a broader range of people hold the police force to account 
of course the pcc works with the chief constable to set budgets and priorities  and of course that has an impact on the priorities of the police   the relationship is complicated  i am not setting my face against it  but i say to the government that  as i will come on to explain  just throwing fire services in with pccs has not been thought through adequately one of the most welcome proposals in the bill  as my hon  friend the member for barrow and furness  john woodcock  said a moment ago  is the closing of the loophole whereby officers can escape disciplinary proceedings by resigning or retiring  clause 22 stipulates that disciplinary proceedings may be initiated up to 12 months after somebody has left the force  i welcome the intention  but the 12 month period could  as my hon  friend said  be unduly restrictive  we know from recent experience that it may take many more years for campaigners to uncover wrongdoing  many of the hillsborough families feel very strongly indeed about this  yet the measure would not have helped them  why is there any time limit at all  wrongdoing  whenever it occurred  needs to be corrected and people need to be held to account  will the full range of disciplinary sanctions be applied  including reductions to pension entitlement in the most serious cases  that is what campaigners want to see reform of police bail is also overdue  the current system has been criticised from both sides  that it unfairly leaves people languishing for long periods  and that  for those who pose more of a risk to the public  it is toothless  what is therefore needed is a more targeted approach that does not place unfair restrictions on the liberty of people who are low risk or whose guilt is far from proven  but is much tougher where it needs to be  in particular in cases of serious crime or terrorism  i have to say  however  that on this the bill does only half a job  it relaxes police bail requirements for the majority of people  but it fails to bring in tougher conditions for those who pose a greater risk  we welcome the new presumption against bail and the time limits  but it has been suggested that because the threshold for extension is so low it simply requires an officer to have acted diligently the proposals may make little difference in practice  i hope that is not the case the big problem is that the government have failed to act on toughening up the police bail regime  the case of siddhartha dhar  who absconded while on police bail and went to syria via dover  is a prime example of the unacceptable loophole in the current system  people will find it truly shocking that terror suspects can waltz out of the country without any real difficulty  i find it astounding that the government have not moved to close the loophole 
absolutely  people would expect that terror suspects would be placed on watch lists immediately    the minute they are placed on police bail   but it appears that that did not happen in this case the prime minister told the liaison committee in january that he would look carefully at stronger police bail powers  but the bill does not deliver them and nor does it close the loophole  the basic problem is that police bail conditions are not enforceable  as such  the bill misses a major opportunity  so we will press the government hard in committee to correct the situation  we need a tougher and targeted police bail regime that  when dealing with more serious offences  can impose enforceable sanctions  such as the confiscation of passports and travel documents in terrorism related cases the proposed reforms on mental health are timely and much needed  given the levels of stress and insecurity inherent in 21st century living  mental health will be one of the greatest   if not the greatest   health challenges of this century  so it is essential that the police and the criminal justice system develop basic standards to deal with it  we therefore strongly welcome moves to ban the use of police cells for children in crisis and to introduce limits on their use for adults  and we also support limiting the time for which people can be held  our concern is not with the measures themselves  but whether they can be delivered in practice as shadow health secretary  i revealed in the previous parliament how the government had not honoured their commitment to parity between physical and mental health  but instead cut mental health more deeply than other parts of the nhs  as a consequence  mental health services in many parts of the country are today in crisis  only last week  richard barber  a councillor from golborne in my constituency  contacted me to say that he had worked with professionals for two days to help to find a tier 4 bed for a highly vulnerable young man who was close to suicide  shockingly  no beds were available anywhere in the country  as the royal college of psychiatrists has pointed out  banning the use of cells  as welcome as that is  does not solve the problem of why those cells are used in the first place  similarly  reducing the time limit for assessment does not itself guarantee enough trained professionals to deliver the new standard the combination of the changes could put professionals in a difficult position  assessments to detain under the mental health act 1983 cannot be completed until a bed has been identified  so the bill could put professionals in the invidious position of having to choose between breaking the law  by going over the 24 hour period if a bed cannot be identified  and not breaking the law but releasing someone who should be detained  it is therefore essential that  alongside the bill  the home secretary and the health secretary issue new instructions to health service commissioners to open sufficient beds and train sufficient professionals to deliver these welcome new commitments 
that is the problem  professionals searching for a bed are in a desperate position because of the lack of information  the risk is that if the new requirements come into law without a plan to commission the extra beds and professionals needed  that could have perverse consequences by putting professionals in a difficult position  i hope that that does not happen  but i say to the home secretary that much more than £15 million will be needed to create adequate bed capacity to deal with the problem finally  i come to the proposals that give us the greatest concern  the first of which is for a major expansion in the number of volunteers  the home secretary was right to praise the role of specials  but we argue that volunteers should add value  rather than replace core police provision  as we have revealed  police forces in england are facing a decade of real terms cuts  we lost 18 000 officers in the last parliament  and many more are set to go in this one  that is the context in which the house must consider the proposal in the bill to extend the use of volunteers the house should not endorse the principle that volunteers can safely backfill the gaps left by cuts to policing  as has been pointed out  the bill in effect gives police volunteers the ability to use cs gas and pava spray  but most people would argue that those functions should be restricted to full time officers  we are not opposed to the greater use of volunteers  but they should come on top of a protected core of police officers to add value  rather than being replacements 
i say to all government members that an increased reliance on volunteers is no way to backfill cuts to core provision  volunteers can add value   they can extend the reach of emergency services   but they are no substitute when filling the gaps left by cuts to front line services that potentially leave the public at risk  the hon  gentleman might be happy with a part time police force or a part time fire service  but i can tell him that most of my constituents would argue that that is not acceptable and that we need sufficient full time resources on the front line to keep people safe 
clearly the hon  gentleman was not listening because i praised the role of police specials and said that there was a role for volunteers  i happen to believe  however  that it is not fair to put those volunteers in dangerous positions without the powers  without the training and without the resources to do the job properly  if he thinks that emergency services that are increasingly run by volunteers represents the right way for us to go  i can inform him that opposition members seriously disagree with him the most worrying part of the bill is part 1  given its implications for the future of fire and rescue services  fire services have already faced severe cuts over the past five years  and they face another five years of deep cuts to front line services  our worry is that the bill could make them even more vulnerable and could lead to fire and rescue services disappearing altogether as separate services  there is a real concern that the proposals to put fire under the control of police and crime commissioners has simply not been thought through  i am sure that the home secretary agrees that this is a major change  so will she answer this question  where is the green paper or the white paper examining the pros and cons for such a change to the governance of our emergency services 
i am afraid that the home secretary needs to be corrected on a lot of that  first  although  yes  she did consult  she consulted purely on the process by which a pcc would take over fire  not the principle of whether they should do so  i stand entirely by the comments of my hon  friend the member for birmingham  erdington  jack dromey   a combined authority is not a police and crime commissioner  it is a very different thing altogether  such a structure keeps fire within local government  which is where it has been for some time there is another reason why independence is important  the home secretary proposes a single employer model  which could lead to the end of a separate fire service  but there are good reasons why the fire service has traditionally been separate from the police  in some inner city areas with a history of tension with the police  the independence of the fire service is important because that means that the service can continue to operate even if there are difficulties or a stand off with the police the knight review considered the possible benefits of greater collaboration  which we support  and an expanded role for pccs  but it also advised the government to pilot the proposal carefully  given the complexity of governance  however  the bill goes much further than that and  most worryingly of all  it takes away any say for local people  it effectively allows a pcc to make a case to the home secretary and then gives her full power to decide  thus completely cutting out the role of local elected representatives  not to mention the public  what on earth happened to the government’s commitment to devolution  just as with metro mayors  it looks like these expanded pccs will be mandated from the centre  the government have not made the case for changing the fire service in this way  and nor have they shown how the independence and funding of the fire service will be protected under the new system  the fire service  as the junior partner in the arrangement  will be more vulnerable to cuts i know that the concerns i have outlined are held by not only labour councillors  but conservative councillors  as the nods that i see from government members appear to indicate  i give notice tonight that unless the government can show how fire services will be protected  with local people given the final say  labour will vote on report to oppose this ill thought proposal  our fire services have been chopped and changed enough  it is time to make a stand for the fire service and to show the thousands of dedicated firefighters that we recognise their important separate role  rather than letting the service end up as a division of the police  which is what the government seem to want  labour will propose an alternative future for the fire and rescue service and how it responds to future challenges  which will include a statutory responsibility to deal with flooding i am sure that i have heard the policing minister say more than once that he used to be a fireman  well  it seems that this former fireman has been given a mission   perhaps to lull people into a sense of false security   of overseeing the demise of the fire service as a separate entity  i can tell him tonight that we are not going to let it go without a fight 
i give way one last time 
crime has fallen   that is absolutely correct   but the risk of a major incident has risen lately  and the recent floods have shown that the emergency services can face considerable pressures  it is not for me to set out the right level of provision  it is for the government to say how far the fire cuts can go before we expose the public to unacceptable risk  does the hon  gentleman think it is acceptable for the fire service in greater manchester to be effectively cut in half  many experts in my area do not consider that that is acceptable and believe that the cuts have already gone too far  it is for the government to prove that they will guarantee public safety the back of an envelope plans for police volunteers and merged emergency services spoil what would otherwise be a good bill  the home secretary and i have worked constructively together in the past  so i hope that she may be prepared to work with me to address some of the concerns that i have outlined  in that spirit  labour will not vote against the bill  but unless there are real moves towards a tougher police bail regime  more accountability for retired police officers and better protection for the fire service  we will seek divisions in the house on report  come what may  we will continue to argue that our emergency services cannot keep us safe in a changing world when we have year on year cuts such as these  what the services need is a convincing  funded plan for the future that they can get behind and that can keep the public safe  and if the government will not provide that  labour will 
i have huge respect for the hon  gentleman and for his campaigning on these issues over many years  i am listening to his speech carefully  does he agree with the point that i made that £15 million is not enough  as there is a huge shortage of crisis beds across the country  does he think that there may be risks in enacting these proposals before major investment is put into mental health crisis services 
just to clarify  i was talking not about voting against the bill per se   as i said  it is a good bill  and we like many of the measures in it   but about voting on report against the proposals on fire  police bail  which  if not strong enough  we will want to strengthen  and police accountability  where we believe that retirement should not free police officers from having to facing up to past wrongdoing 
i am listening carefully to what the hon  gentleman is saying  but will not the bill make things even more complicated by providing for local authority control  traditional fire authority control  potential elected mayoral control and then another model of pcc control   even within that  as the bill states  there are three models of pcc oversight  will that not be even more complicated 
will the minister give way 
i echo the condolences the home secretary rightly paid to the family of the police officer in northern ireland who lost his life in the course of his duties  they are in our thoughts today let me start with the principle on which i think there is broad agreement  from the government benches to the opposition benches  from liberty to the security services  there is a consensus that the country needs to update its laws in this crucial area  and that  if the police and security services are to be given new powers  there must be broad agreement that those powers be balanced with much stronger safeguards for the public than have previously existed  that  it seems to me  is a good platform from which to start the bill is commonly seen through the prism of terrorism  but  as the home secretary said  it is about much more  the parents of a young child who had gone missing would want the police to have full and urgent access to all the information they need to bring them to safety  the bill is about the ability to locate missing children or vulnerable adults  it is about reducing risks to children from predatory activities online  it is about preventing extremists of any kind creating fear and hatred in our communities  and it is about defending the liberties we all enjoy each and every day  despite that  the truth is that we are some way from finding a consensus on the form the proposed legislation should take three months after i was elected to this house  two planes flew into the world trade centre in new york  with highly traumatic consequences  in the 15 years since  we have all been engaged on a frantic search  what is the right balance between individual privacy and collective security in the digital age  as of yet  we have not managed to find it  the arguments in the previous parliament over the forerunner to this bill loom over our debate today  as does the current stand off in the united states between apple and the fbi  i would say that that is an unhelpful backdrop to this debate  it suggests that privacy and security concerns are irreconcilable  a question of either or  choosing one over the other  i do not believe that is the case  we all share an interest in maximising both our individual privacy on the one hand and our collective security on the other  as a house of commons  our goal should be to give our constituents both finding that point of balance between the two should be our task over the next nine months  as the home secretary knows  i have offered to play a constructive part in achieving that  the simple fact is that britain needs a new law in this area  outright opposition  which some are proposing tonight  risks sinking the bill and leaving the interim laws in place  to go along with that would be to abdicate our responsibility to the police  security services and  most importantly  the public  i am not prepared to do that  just as importantly  it would leave the public with much weaker safeguards in place and i am not prepared to do that either 
i will not be joining the hon  gentleman in the lobby tonight  because i do not believe  as i will come on to explain  that the bill is acceptable in its current form  as he will have heard me say in my opening remarks  i am in broad agreement with the government’s objectives  i am not seeking to play politics with the bill or to drag it down  i hope he will find some assurance in those words 
i disagree entirely  as i said  we will not oppose the bill because we will be responsible  i have recognised that the country needs a new law  i have also said  as i will come on to explain  that the bill is not yet worthy of support  there are significant weaknesses in the bill  i am sorry  but i am not prepared to go through the lobby tonight and give the hon  gentleman and his government a blank cheque  i want to hold the government to account  i want to see changes in the bill to strengthen the bill  when they listen  they will earn our support  that is entirely appropriate and responsible for an opposition party to do the higher the consensus we can establish behind the bill  the more we will create the right climate in the country for its introduction  as the home secretary said  it could create a template to be copied around the world  advancing the cause of human rights in the 21st century  the prize is great and that is why i am asking those on the opposition benches to work constructively towards it i repeat today that i do not think our mission is helped by misrepresentation  in my view  it is lazy to label the bill as a snoopers’ charter or a plan for mass surveillance  in fact  it is worse than lazy  it is insulting to people who work in the police and in the security services  it implies that they choose to do the jobs they do because they are busybodies who like to spy on the public  rather than serve the public  i do not accept that characterisation of those people  it is unfair and it diminishes the difficult work they do to keep us safe 
i agree with the hon  lady  the idea that they have the time to do that is fanciful  they are going straight to the people they need to be concerned about on our behalf  and that is why i reject the characterisation that is often placed on this proposed legislation 
we need to explore the plans in detail  as i said  i do not accept that the bill is a plan for mass surveillance  but we need to work hard over the next nine months to take those concerns away that said  there are well founded concerns about the bill  as we just heard  there is a genuine worry that providing for the accumulation of large amounts of personal data presents risks to people’s privacy and online security  more specifically  there is a worry that investigatory powers can be abused and have been abused in the past  in recent years  there have been revelations about how bereaved families  justice campaigners  environmental campaigners  journalists and trade unionists have been subject to inappropriate police investigation  what justification could there ever have been for the metropolitan police to put the noble baroness lawrence and her family under surveillance  it has not been proven but i know that the hillsborough families strongly suspect that the same was done to them 
i have had such representations  as the government have  which is why i said the bill was about much more than terrorism  it is about giving the police and the security services the tools they need to keep us safe in the 21st century  that is why i am not playing politics with the bill or adopting a knee jerk oppositionist approach  i am taking quite a careful and considered approach  that said  the government have not yet done enough to earn my support 
i will let the hon  gentleman form his own view on the right parliamentary tactics for the opposition  but i will be deciding that position  and i do not think i would be serving the public simply by giving the government a blank cheque this evening  it is my job     interruption   wait a second    to hold them to account on behalf of the public and to get the most i can to protect the public as best we can through the bill  i am approaching that job  as part of her majesty’s opposition  with the utmost seriousness alongside bereaved families  there have been cases of journalists claiming that material was inappropriately seized from them  most recently in connection with the “plebgate” affair  last year  a former senior police officer turned whistleblower came to an event in parliament and said that he and a colleague had been involved in supplying information that led to the blacklisting of construction workers  i would refer those who claim that these fears are exaggerated to the biggest unresolved case of this kind   the 1972 national building workers’ strike and the convictions of 24 pickets  known as the shrewsbury 24  it is widely believed that their prosecution was politically orchestrated  with the help of the police and security services 
i give way to my hon  friend  who knows a great deal about this matter and has championed those still fighting for justice 
my hon  friend puts it very well  which is why fears about such legislation run deep on the labour benches  we know the truth about what happened  even though it is not widely known yet by the public  because we have seen the documents  i have here a memo from the security services sent at the time to a senior foreign office official   i am glad that the foreign secretary is winding up tonight  because this concerns his department  it is headed “secret” and talks about the preparation of a television programme that went out and the trial of the shrewsbury pickets  and it says  at the top “we had a discreet but considerable hand in this programme” that is from the security services  so why would people on the labour benches not fear handing over more power to the police and security services without there being adequate safeguards 
it happened close to the hon  gentleman’s constituency  so i will give way 
i will come to that very point  but these are not historical matters  because the convictions i just referred to still stand  i pay tribute to the government  because they have a good record on this  but we need to go further to give the full truth about some of the darkest chapters in our country’s past  so that we can learn from them and then build the right safeguards into the bill  the bill will fail unless it entirely rules out the possibility that abuses of the kind i have mentioned could ever happen again  that is the clear test i am setting for the bill that is also why i welcome the principle of the bill  it leaves behind us the murky world of policing in the ‘70s  ’80s and ’90s  and holds out the possibility of creating a modern and open framework that makes our services more accountable while containing much improved safeguards for ordinary people  the bill makes progress towards that goal  but it is far from there yet  it is clear that the home secretary has been in listening mode and responded to the reports of the three parliamentary committees  but of the 122 recommendations in the three reports  the government have reflected less than half in the revised bill  she will need to be prepared to listen more and make further significant changes to the bill if she is to achieve her goal of getting it on to the statute book by december i want to take the house through six specific concerns that we have with the bill  the first is on privacy  as i said  people have a right to maximise their personal privacy  and given people’s worries about the misuse of personal data  the intelligence and security committee was surely right to recommend that privacy considerations be at the heart of the bill  a presumption of privacy would set the right context and provide the basis from which the exceptional powers are drawn  it would be the right foundation for the whole bill  respect for privacy and clarity that any intrusions into it require serious justification  the home secretary said that privacy protection was hardwired into the bill  i find it hard to accept that statement  i see the changes on this point as more cosmetic  they have not directly answered the committee’s concerns  i therefore ask the government to reflect further on this matter and to include a much stronger overarching privacy requirement  as recommended by the committee  covering all the separate powers outlined in the bill also on privacy  we do not yet believe that the government have gone far enough to protect the role of sensitive professions  the committee noted that the safeguards for certain professions must be applied consistently across the bill  no matter which investigatory power is being used to obtain the information  but it is hard to see how that is achieved at the moment  on mps and other elected representatives  the bill codifies the wilson doctrine  but there is a question about why it stops short of requiring the prime minister to approve a warrant and requires only that he be consulted  the bill could be strengthened in that regard  on legal privilege  the law society has said that  although it is pleased to see that the government have acknowledged legal professional privilege  it needs more adequate protection  and it believes that that should be in the bill  not just the codes that go with it 
i do agree with the right hon  gentleman  i was making the point that the provisions need to be strengthened in respect of prime ministerial approval  but also in the way that he describes to give our constituents that extra trust  so that if they come to speak to us in our surgeries  they can be sure that they are speaking to us and nobody else 
i think the home secretary has indicated that there would be  because her decision would be subject to the double lock  including judicial approval  my point is  why should the prime minister be only consulted by the home secretary as part of that process  it seems to me that there is a role for the prime minister finally to approve any such warrant  and i believe the bill could be strengthened in that regard there is also the question of journalists  the national union of journalists believes that the bill weakens existing provisions  clause 68  which makes the only reference to journalists in the entire bill  sets out a judicial process for the revelation of a source  its concern is that journalists are wide open to other powers in the bill  given the degree of trust people need to raise concerns via the political  legal or media route  and given the importance of that to democracy  i think the government need to do further work in this area to win the trust and support of those crucial professions our second area of concern relates to the thresholds for use of the powers  the bill creates a range of powers that vary in intrusiveness  from use of communications data and internet connection records at one end to intercept  equipment interference and bulk powers at the other end  there is a real concern that the thresholds for them are either too low or too vague let us take internet connection records  the home secretary has previously described icrs as “the modern equivalent” of the “itemised phone bill”  and the government intend them to be made available on the same basis   that is  for the detection or prevention of any crime  the joint committee noted  however  that this is not a helpful description or comparison  icrs will reveal much more about somebody than an itemised phone bill  they are closer to an itinerary  revealing places that people have visited the question for the house is this  is it acceptable for this level of personal information to be accessed in connection with any crime   antisocial behaviour or motoring offences  for instance  i do not believe it is  and i think a higher hurdle is needed  this is a critical point that the government will need to answer if they are to secure wider public support for their bill  people have legitimate fears that if icrs become the common currency in law enforcement  much more information will be circulating about them  with the potential for it to be misused the government need to tell us more about why they need this new power and they need to set a stricter test for its use   in connection with the prevention or detection of more serious crime or a serious incident such as a missing person  for instance  that is what i think the hurdle should be  serious crime rather than any crime  and i would welcome hearing the home secretary’s response on that point at the other end of the scale  the justification for using the most intrusive powers in the bill is on grounds of “national security” or  as the home secretary said  “economic well being”  while i understand the need for operational flexibility  there is a long standing concern that those tests are far too broad  there is a feeling that “national security” has been used to cover a multitude of sins in the past  let us remember that official papers from the domestic building workers’ strike in english market towns in 1972 are still being withheld on grounds of “national security”  how on earth could that possibly be justified 
i do not believe it is  i put it to the hon  gentleman that national security is a very broad term that is not defined in the bill  the joint committee encouraged the government to define it in order to give people greater security  as i have just said  activities have been carried out in the past under the banner of national security that i think he would struggle to justify as such the problem with the “economic well being” test is that it potentially opens up a much wider range of activities to the most intrusive powers  the bill states that matters of economic well being must be only “relevant” to national security  not directly connected to it  as the home secretary seems to imply  this raises the issue of what extra activities the government want to cover under this banner that are not covered by national security  a cyber attack on the city of london has been mentioned  but surely that would already be covered by national security provisions let me put two suggestions to the home secretary  first  i suggest that she accept the joint committee’s invitation to define “national security” more explicitly  alongside terrorism and serious crime  it could include attacks on the country’s critical or commercial infrastructure  secondly  if she were to do that  the economic well being test could be dropped altogether  that would build reassurance among opposition members that there could be no targeting in future of law abiding trades unionists  as we have seen happening in the past the third area of concern is with icrs themselves   both their content and their use 
i would gladly share with the right hon  and learned gentleman some of the papers i have about the historic injustices that we have seen in this country     interruption   but it is relevant  because those convictions still stand to this day  i said earlier   i do not know whether he was in his place   that revelations have been made that information supplied to blacklist people in the construction industry came from the police and the security services  i welcome the move to codify all this in law so that those abuses cannot happen again  but i hope that he will understand that labour members want to leave nothing to doubt  why should the most intrusive warrants be used on the test of economic well being  what does that mean  are we not entitled to say that national security alone can justify intrusion on people’s privacy in that way 
i am not doing that in any way  shape or form  it is wrong for the home secretary to stand there and imply that i was  what i am talking about is the grounds on which her bill gives the police and the security services the ability to apply for warrants    interruption   conservative members should listen  i am saying to the home secretary and to them that those grounds should be as tightly defined as possible  and i do not think it helps if she is proposing that they can be brought forward on grounds of “general economic well being”  in the past  her party has taken a different view from ours  and this opens up a much wider range of potential activities that could be subject to the most intrusive warrants  that point is both fair and  if i may say so  well made 
has the hon  gentleman been listening  i began by saying the very same thing and said that we would work with the government to get it right  but surely i am entitled  am i not  to raise specific concerns about the wording in the bill   in this case  wording about “economic well being”  which i believe opens up a large range of activities that could fit under that banner  i am saying to government members that if they want my help  they should help us get that definition right to reassure the public 
my hon  friend has put it very well  it is a fact that trade unionists and other campaigners have been subject  over time  to inappropriate use of investigatory powers  if the conservatives do not understand that  they need to go away and look into the issues  they need to get at the full truth about orgreave and shrewsbury  so that they can understand why some people who do not share their political views on life have a different feeling about legislation of this kind  if they did go away and do that  they would probably find that they could reassure people  and that there would be more public support for the bill 
i am going to make some more progress now as i understand it  the intention of the authorities in building internet connection records is to list domains visited  but not uniform resource locators  there would not be a web browsing history  as the home secretary said  the icrs would show the “front doors” of sites that had been visited online  but not where people went when they were inside  that will give some reassurance to people who fear something more extensive  but the definition of icrs in clause 54 remains extremely vague and broad  i see nothing that would prevent them from becoming much more detailed and intrusive over time  as technology evolves  the draft code of practice gives an illustration of what would be included  but it does not build confidence  as it acknowledges that information may vary from provider to provider it would help everyone if the government set out a much stricter definition of what can and cannot be included in icrs  and  in particular  specified that they can include domains but not urls  the current confusion about icrs is unhelpful and clouds the debate about the bill  it needs to be cleared up as for the use of icrs  schedule 4 sets out far too broad a range of public bodies that will be able to access them  it seems to me that the net has been cast much too widely  is it really necessary for the food standards agency and the gambling commission to have powers to access an individual’s internet connection record  i will be testing the government on that  if there were a suspicion of serious criminality in respect of the food chain or a betting syndicate  surely it would be better to refer it to the police at that point  i must say to the home secretary that we shall want to see a much reduced list before this part of the bill becomes acceptable to us 
i do agree  if such information were published  it would reveal far more about someone than an itemised phone bill  the home secretary began this whole process by saying that they were the same  and that this was simply the modern equivalent  it is not  it would reveal a great deal about someone the reassurance that i would hope to give is that it is not necessary to limit the information  but it is necessary to raise the threshold allowing the records to be accessed  in order to make this a test of serious crime rather than any crime  at present  the bill refers to “any crime”  but i do not think it acceptable for the kind of information to which the right hon  gentleman referred to be available in the context of lower level offences  i hope that he may be able to support me on that point our fourth area of concern relates to bulk powers  it is a fact that criminals and terrorists  operating both here and overseas  may use a variety of means to conceal their tracks and make it hard for the authorities to penetrate closed or encrypted communications networks  i accept the broad argument advanced by the authorities that power to extract information in bulk form can provide the only way of identifying those who pose a risk to the public  but the greater use of some of those bulk powers takes investigatory work into new territory  the routine gathering of large quantities of information from ordinary people presents significant privacy concerns  and points to a need for the warrants to be as targeted as possible  the operational case for the individual bulk powers was published by the government alongside the bill  but it is fair to say that the detail has failed to convince everyone  it is still for the government to convince people that the powers are needed 
i thank the hon  and learned lady for the law tutorial  her point may be one for committee rather than second reading  however  i did refer to it earlier  the bill uses the word “relevant”  it does not use the words “directly linked to national security”  she pulls a face  but i am sure that i speak for every labour member when i say that there is no room for ambiguity when it comes to these matters  the government must be absolutely clear about what they mean  we have seen trade unionists targeted in the past on the basis of similar justifications  and we will not allow it to happen again 
i disagree  i am making a legitimate point about which we feel strongly  i am saying that the most intrusive powers in the bill should be strictly limited to national security  the hon  gentleman has a different view  but i believe that serious crime and national security should be the strictly limited grounds on which the most intrusive warrants are applied for  i hope that he will approach the issue in a spirit similar to the one in which i have approached it  i hope that he will look into the concern that i have raised in more detail and try to understand why labour members feel so strongly about it 
that is an important point  which i shall come to in a moment i was talking about bulk powers  important concerns were raised by the intelligence and security committee about scope  oversight and the more generic class warrants  and i do not believe that they have been adequately answered  one of the joint committee’s recommendations was that the government should establish an independent review of all the bulk powers in the bill  given the complexity and sensitivity of the issue  i think that the house would benefit from that  so my specific ask is for the home secretary to commission such a review  to be concluded in time for report and third reading our fifth concern is about judicial oversight  and relates to one of our earliest demands in respect of the bill  the government have given significant ground in this area  and  as the home secretary said  the bill is stronger as a result  however  we believe that it could be stronger still  it currently says that  when deciding whether to approve a decision to issue a warrant  a judicial commissioner must apply“the same principles as would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review ”the point has just been made by the hon  and learned member for edinburgh south west  joanna cherry  i have previously shared with the home secretary my fear that that could mean a narrower test  taking account of only the process and reasonableness of the home secretary’s decision rather than the actual merits and substance of an application  i was listening carefully to what she said at the dispatch box earlier  and i thought i heard her provide reassurance that a much broader consideration could be provided by a judicial commissioner  i hope that that is the case  and if it is  why not delete the judicial review clause from the bill  that would make it absolutely clear this is not just a double lock but an equal lock  in which the judicial commissioner has the same ability look at the entire merits of the case our sixth and final concern relates to the misuse of the powers  i accept the concerns of the police federation that there need to be safeguards for the collection of data in a lawful manner  but i also agree with its view that the bill needs to make it clearer that an overarching criminal offence is created for the deliberate misuse of any of the powers  that should relate to the obtaining of data and to any use to which those data are subsequently put  both should be a criminal offence  that would provide an extra safeguard for the public i have set out six substantive issues that must be addressed  given the seriousness of these concerns  people have questioned why we are not voting with the government tonight     interruption   we are voting neither with them nor against them  the simple answer is that we need new legislation but the bill is not yet good enough  that is why we have set these tests  simply to block this legislation would in my view be irresponsible  it would leave the police and security services in limbo and  as communications migrate online  that would make their job harder  we must give them the tools they need to do the job  if we did not put new legislation on the statute book  we would leave the public exposed to greater risk because they would not have the safeguards that are in the bill however  let me be clear that there is no blank cheque here for the government  we will not be voting for the bill tonight because it is some way from being good enough  and if the government fail to respond adequately to the concerns i have raised  i give notice to them that we will withdraw our support for the timetabling of the bill  it is as simple as that  the public interest lies in getting this right and in not sacrificing quality to meet the deadline  the time has come for the house to lay politics aside and to find a point of balance between privacy and security in the digital age that can command broad public support we on these benches have worked hard to uncover the truth about some of the dark chapters in our country’s past precisely so that we can learn from them and make this country fairer for those coming after us  i want a bill that helps the authorities to do their job but protects ordinary people from intrusion and abuse by those in positions of power  i also want britain to be a country that gives its people individual privacy and collective security  our shared goal should be a bill that enhances our privacy  security and democracy and   with goodwill and give and take on both sides   i believe that that is within our grasp several hon  members rose   
the hon  and learned lady has made a very good speech this afternoon  government members should be working a little harder to reach out and build consensus  before she finishes  may i invite her to say whether she will be supporting our call in committee and on report to make internet connection records accessible only through a warrant based on serious crime  not any crime  to give protection  and also for a clear definition of national security 
i am listening to the right hon  gentleman’s remarks  and i did similar things as a minister  but is it not the case that a politician’s mind will always turn to the question  “what if i don’t sign this ”  and the public embarrassment that might come from not signing  is not the further judicial check a helpful double lock so that a politician need not worry that a failure to agree might lead to public embarrassment 
i am listening very carefully to my right hon  gentleman and i agree entirely with everything he has said  before he finishes  will he say a little more about the committee’s recommendation on the definition of national security  the committee raised that as a concern and the term has been used to cover a multitude of activities  does he agree that it would be better for the government to provide a clear definition of national security in the bill and to drop the justification of economic wellbeing for the more intrusive warrants 
i am grateful to the minister for giving way  but some of the things that he has said tonight will be disputed by some in the sikh community  i do not want to get into a debate about the organisation’s history  but the strong feeling in the sikh community is that some decisions were based on diplomatic pressure from the indian government  rather than on the direct evidence of terrorism that he describes  i am not proving the case one way or the other  but can the minister say without any contradiction that diplomatic pressure did not lead to the ban being maintained for so long 
i am grateful to the minister for giving way again and i appreciate that he wants to get through his speech  but these are matters of great concern to many in the british sikh community  so they will want to hear further answers from the minister  he says that the government changed their mind when the evidence was reconsidered  but that was only after they were taken all the way to the high court and had resisted representatives of the sikh community at every single stage  the minister needs to remove any suggestion that the ban has been maintained for so long because of pressure from the indian government 
the opposition support everything that the home secretary has said  and we assure her of our continued full support in confronting this threat  today  our thoughts are with the families of those killed or injured  with the family of the british person who is missing and with the people of brussels we think of all the people who have suffered in all the attacks that the home secretary mentioned  including those last week in istanbul and ankara  this was more than an attack on belgium  it was an attack on the heart of europe and on all of europe   a statement of intent from the terrorists  which must be met with a raised and renewed determination to defeat them first  let me start with the immediate advice to uk citizens  we welcome the support that is being provided to those caught up in the chaos  but as we approach easter  many families may have travel plans that include travelling to  or through  belgium  will the government consider issuing more detailed travel guidance to them so that they can make informed decisions based on the best available information secondly  on international collaboration  can the home secretary say more about the nature of the immediate support that has been provided to belgium  people will have seen reports suggesting that the suspects were linked to the attacks in paris and known to belgian police  that raises the question of whether the belgian authorities have sufficient capability to deal with the extent of the problem  is there more that can be done to support them on a longer term basis  more broadly  given the global nature of the threat  the home secretary was entirely right to talk about our collaboration with all european partners thirdly  on border security  we are learning more about the extent of terror networks in belgium  as we do  it raises questions about travel between the uk and belgium  britain has extensive air  sea and rail borders with belgium  we welcome the immediate steps taken yesterday to strengthen the presence at our borders  but is there now a case for a longer term review border force operates juxtaposed controls at six locations in france  however  in respect of belgium  juxtaposed controls apply only on eurostar and not at ferry terminals  will the home secretary immediately initiate a review of our borders with belgium  with a view to strengthening them  she knows of the concerns that i have raised before about uk terror suspects on police bail who have fled the country through sea ports  and we propose to table an amendment to the policing and crime bill to close that loophole  will she today give a commitment to work with us on that more broadly on borders  i have serious concerns about further cuts that are coming following the spending review  border force has faced years of cuts and is already stretched to the limit  the new financial year starts in a week’s time  but i notice that the home office is still to publish a 2016 17 budget for border force  will the home secretary correct that today  so that there can be a debate about whether that budget is enough  surely now is the time to strengthen our borders  not to cut them fourthly  on uk preparedness  we know that seven terror plots have been foiled here in the last 12 months  and we thank all those in the police and security services who are working to keep us safe  but we must keep our own arrangements under review  the public will want reassurance about our ability to cope with a paris or brussels style attack   multiple  simultaneous incidents designed to cause maximum fear and confusion  we know that plans are in hand to improve firearms capability in london  and we welcome those  but there is concern about the ability of cities outside london to cope a home office report on firearms capability published in july 2015 found that the number of armed officers had fallen by 15  since 2008  including a fall of 27  in greater manchester and 25  in merseyside there was a report in the observer late last year that scotland yard had briefed the home secretary on its fears about the lack of capacity in regional forces to respond to terror attacks  is that true  and can she say more about it  has she reviewed the ability of all major cities to respond  and can she provide assurance today that if there were to be a paris or brussels style attack outside london  our police and fire services would have the necessary capability to respond in conclusion  while we think of the belgian people today  we remember  too  that many victims of attacks around the world are muslims  which suggests that this terror is not about islam  we also know that  at moments such as this  great anxiety will be felt in the british muslim community  with fears of reprisal attacks  rising islamophobia and hate crime  does the home secretary recognise those concerns  and will she today send an unequivocal message to anyone who seeks to promote division or hate on the back of these attacks that they will be dealt with severely  will she condemn the ill informed comments made on uk television today by donald trump and take this opportunity to distance the uk government from them  they play into the hands of the terrorists  they are intended to drive a wedge between the muslim community and the rest of society  who are united in revulsion at what happened yesterday daesh called the innocent people who died and were injured “crusaders”  they were nothing of the sort  they were ordinary  innocent people of all faiths and none  living side by side in one of europe’s great cities  this is a moment not for division  but for maximum unity among peoples of all faiths and none   a moment to reject those who preach islamophobia  anti semitism and all forms of extremism  let the unanimous message go out from this house today that we stand together across it as a united country  that we stand with our neighbour belgium in its hour of need  and that  whatever it takes  and however long it takes  we will face and defeat this threat to our way of life together 
in the aftermath of the attacks in brussels and paris  the security of the uk border is uppermost in people’s minds  however  we are a fortnight into the new financial year  and the home secretary is still refusing to answer questions on the budget for border force  a whistleblower says staff were told three weeks ago to expect front line cuts of 6   although  since media reports of that came out  we hear that the home office has been back pedalling  i hope the home secretary is backing down  because our borders cannot face cuts on this scale  i therefore invite her to clear the issue up today  what is the 2016 17 budget for border force  and is it up or down on last year 
it will not have escaped the notice of the house or anybody watching that the home secretary has not answered the question  we know that financial transparency and this government do not go well together  as we are about to hear  but what are the government trying to hide  i hope the delay in publishing the budget is due to the fact that she is listening to us and backing down on those 6  cuts let me turn to another area where the home secretary is moving under labour pressure  police bail for terror suspects  i have called on the government for months to close a loophole that has allowed individuals on bail  such as siddhartha dhar  to leave the country for syria  i welcome the fact that the government last week indicated that they are prepared to move on the issue  but i am worried that they are not going far enough  does the home secretary agree that passports and travel documents should be surrendered as a condition of release from police custody  will she work with labour to amend the policing and crime bill to that end 
 urgent question   to ask the home secretary to make a statement setting out the details of the border force budget for 2016 17 
finally  an answer   and yet another u turn   from the home secretary  let us be clear  it is labour pressure that has brought her to the house today  and labour pressure that has made her back down on her planned deeper cuts in the uk border  just as we forced her to u turn on police funding  we have now forced her to u turn on the border force budget  she has spent the last two weeks ducking and diving  refusing to answer questions that i put to her in the house and that the chair of the home affairs committee  my right hon  friend the member for leicester east  keith vaz   put to her senior officials   i pay tribute to the right hon  gentleman for his determination  why could the home secretary not answer our questions  because she has been furiously back pedalling for the last two weeks  and patching up holes in the border force budget let us be clear about what has just been announced to the house  the home secretary has announced a revenue cut in the border force budget  let me put that into context  she has announced a budget of £558 million  in 2012 13  the budget was £617 million  it has fallen by more than £50 million on her watch  that is this home secretary’s record on border funding  how can she justify it when the terror threat has been increasing all the time  will she guarantee  on the back of the budget that has been announced today  that there will be no cuts in the number of front line immigration officers  and that officers will not be replaced by less trained staff the bigger question  however  is whether the budget that the home secretary has announced is anywhere near enough  today  a group of the most eminent police and counter terrorism experts have written an open letter saying that attacks in paris and brussels must be“a wake up call for the british government”on lax border security worryingly  the letter reveals that the national crime agency has evidence that people traffickers are now specifically targeting weaker sea ports  i have repeatedly warned the home secretary about that  will she accept the call from the group of experts for a review of border security  and for extra resources to plug the gaps those gaps are very real  a whistleblower working at the port of immingham  the country’s largest freight port  has been in touch with me to reveal that the staff of ferry companies  who are carrying out the home secretary’s border exit checks  are simply not trained to do it  that the passports of lorry drivers are not checked on arrival by anyone  and  worst of all  that school leavers are now being recruited to check passports    replacing experienced border officers  border security on the cheap  that is the reality of what is happening at britain’s borders today  under this home secretary  it is the direct consequence of the cuts that she has already made in the uk border during her time in office   and  unbelievably  she wanted to make even further cuts in the border before we in the labour party stopped her the home secretary has spent the last two weeks running scared  scrabbling for loose change behind the back of the home office sofa  but  worse  she has weakened our borders  has damaged our security  and is only now pledging to stop the cuts  on an issue of such importance to the british public  she is going to have to do a lot better than this 
i thank the home secretary for her powerful statement and her kind words  at long last  justice   for the 96  for their families  for all liverpool supporters  for an entire city  but it took too long in coming  and the struggle for it took too great a toll on too many  now  those responsible must be held to account for 96 unlawful deaths and a 27 year cover up thankfully  the jury saw through the lies  i am sure   to repeat what the home secretary said   that the house will join me in thanking the jury for their devotion to this task and for giving two years of their lives to this important public duty when it came  their verdict was simple  clear  powerful and emphatic  but it begged the question  how could something so obvious have taken so long  there are three reasons  first  a police force that has consistently put protecting itself over and above protecting people harmed by hillsborough  secondly  collusion between that force and a complicit print media  and thirdly  a flawed judicial system that gives the upper hand to those in authority  over and above ordinary people  let me take each of those issues in turn  starting with south yorkshire police can the home secretary assure me that there will be no holding back in pursuing prosecutions  the cps has said that files will be submitted by december  while we understand the complexity  can she urge it to do whatever it can to bring that date forward of course  the behaviour of some officers  while reprehensible  was not necessarily chargeable  but  through retirement  police officers can still escape misconduct proceedings  in her policing and crime bill  the home secretary proposes a 12 month period after retirement where proceedings can be initiated  but one of the lessons of hillsborough is that there can be no arbitrary time limits on justice and accountability  will the home secretary work with me to insert a hillsborough clause into her bill  ending the scandal of retirement as an escape route and of wrongdoers claiming full pensions  will she join me in making sure that that applies retrospectively the much bigger question for south yorkshire police to answer today is this  why  at this inquest  did they go back on their 2012 public apology  when the lord chief justice quashed the original inquest  he requested that the new one not degenerate into an “adversarial battle”  sadly  that is exactly what happened  shamefully  the cover up continued in that warrington courtroom  millions of pounds of public money was spent retelling discredited lies against liverpool supporters  lawyers for retired officers threw disgusting slurs around  those for today’s force tried to establish that others were responsible for the opening of the gate  if the police had chosen to maintain their apology  this inquest would have been much shorter  but they did not  and they put the families through hell once again  it pains me to say it  but the nhs  through the yorkshire ambulance service  was guilty of the same does the home secretary agree that  because of his handling of this inquest  the position of the south yorkshire chief constable is now untenable  does she further agree that the problems go deeper  i promised the families the full truth about hillsborough  i do not believe they will have it until we know the truth about orgreave  this force used the same underhand tactics against its own people in the aftermath of the miners’ strike that it would later use to more deadly effect against the people of liverpool  there has been an ipcc report on orgreave  but parts of it are redacted  it has been put to me that those parts contain evidence of direct links between orgreave and hillsborough this is a time for transparency  not secrecy   time for the people of south yorkshire to know the full truth about their police force  so will the home secretary accept the legal submission from the orgreave truth and justice campaign and set up a disclosure process  this force has not learned and has not changed  let me be clear  i do not blame the ordinary police officers   the men and women who did their very best on that day and who today are out there keeping our streets safe   but i do blame their leadership and culture  which seems rotten to the core  orgreave  hillsborough  rotherham  how much more evidence do we need before we act  so will the home secretary now order the fundamental reform of this force and consider all potential options let me turn to collusion between police and the media  the malicious briefings given in the aftermath were devastatingly efficient  they created a false version of events which lingered until yesterday  no one in the police or media has ever been held to account for the incalculable harm they caused in smearing a whole city in its moment of greatest grief  imagine how it felt to be my constituent lee walls  who came through gate c just before 3 pm with his friend carl brown  carl died  but lee survived  but days later he had to read that he was to blame  given the weakness of the press regulatory system back then  the survivors of this tragedy had no ability to correct the lies  but is it any different today  if a tragedy like hillsborough were to happen now  victims would not be able quickly to undo the damage of a misleading front page  leveson recommended a second stage inquiry to look at the sometimes unhealthy relationship between police and press  i know the hillsborough families feel strongly that this should be taken forward  so will the government end the delay and honour the prime minister’s promises to the victims of press intrusion i turn to the judicial system  i attended this inquest on many occasions  i saw how hard it was on the families  trapped for two years in a temporary courtroom  told to show no emotion as police lawyers smeared the dead and those who survived   beyond cruel  i welcome bishop james’s new role in explaining just how cruel this was to the house and to the country  the original inquest was similarly brutal  but that did not even get to the truth  just as the first inquest muddied the waters after the clarity of the taylor report  so this inquest  at moments  lost sight of the hillsborough independent panel report  one of the reasons why it produced a different outcome  though  is that this time the families had the best lawyers in the land  if they could have afforded them back in 1990  history might have been very different  at many inquests today there is often a mismatch between the legal representation of public bodies and those of the bereaved  why should the authorities be able to spend public money like water to protect themselves when families have no such help  so will the government consider further reforms to the coronial system  including giving the bereaved at least equal legal funding as public bodies  this  the longest case in english legal history  must mark a watershed in how victims are treated the last question is for us in this house  what kind of country leaves people who did no more than wave off their loved ones to a football match still sitting in a courtroom 27 years later begging for the reputations of their sons  daughters  brothers  sisters and fathers  the answer is one that needs now to do some deep soul searching  this cover up went right to the top  it was advanced in the committee rooms of this house and in the press rooms of 10 downing street  it persisted because of collusion between elites in politics   on both sides   police and the media  but this home secretary stood outside of that  today i express my sincere admiration and gratitude to her for the stance she has consistently taken in righting this wrong but my final words go to the hillsborough families  i think of those who did not live to see this day  of the courageous anne williams  of my constituent stephen whittle  the “97th victim”  who gave his own ticket to a friend on the morning of the match and later took his own life  i think of people like phil hammond  who sacrificed his own health to this struggle  i think of the many people who died from outside merseyside  recognising that this was not just liverpool’s but the country’s tragedy  i think of leigh lad carl brown and his devoted mum delia who still visits his grave most days  i think of trevor and jenni hicks and their heart breaking testimony to the new inquest  but i think most of my friend margaret aspinall  she did not just sacrifice  everything for her own son james  she took on the heavy burden of fighting for everyone else’s loved ones   and  by god  didn’t she do them proud  it has been the privilege of my life to work with them all  they have prevailed against all the odds  they have kept their dignity in the face of terrible adversity  they could not have shown a more profound love for those they lost on that day  they truly represent the best of what our country is all about  now it must reflect on how it came to let them down for so long    applause  
this has been an excellent and informative debate  during which we have been treated to the marvellous maiden speech of my hon  friend the member for ogmore  chris elmore   he told us that his constituents have set him the goal of being half as good as huw  on today’s evidence  and given that he is already making the case for steelworkers who will lobby parliament tomorrow  he will pass that test with flying colours  we wish him well a clear majority of speakers  particularly my hon  friends the members for birmingham  selly oak  steve mccabe   for ilford south  mike gapes  and for york central  rachael maskell   have made the case that britain will be immeasurably stronger by remaining part of the european union  just as the economic case for leaving has crumbled under questioning in recent days  so today’s debate has put the security case for brexit under intense scrutiny and found it to be illusory  a vote to leave is a vote for isolation  and that simply makes no sense whatsoever in a highly volatile and unpredictable world  nobody put that case more powerfully than my right hon  friend the member for leeds central  hilary benn   the foreign secretary  who gave yet another tour de force in this house    hon  members  “shadow foreign secretary ”  i am sure everyone will agree that it is only a matter of time we agree with the government that our membership of the eu strengthens our security at home and abroad  but we do not agree that the bills in the gracious speech will make our society stronger or fairer  indeed  they could do the opposite  undermine our standing in the world and expose us to greater risks from radicalisation let me quote from the gracious speech “my government will bring forward proposals for a british bill of rights ”that was  in fact  from the 2015 gracious speech  this year’s said “proposals will be brought forward for a british bill of rights ”is it not a little unfair on her majesty to ask her to keep reading out a cut and paste queen’s speech one can speculate why this long promised tory bill of rights has never materialised  might it be because it springs from an impulse for political grandstanding    rather than a carefully thought through response to the challenges of the modern world  i fear that the same can also be said of the counter extremism bill  in both cases it seems that the government are opening pandora’s box without fully knowing where they are going or what they are trying to achieve  in areas as sensitive as these  that is a dangerous thing to do let me take each bill in turn  a few weeks ago  the home secretary gave a speech in which she called for britain to leave the european convention on human rights  what a terrible message that would send to the rest of the world  but what a boost for regimes that seek to deny human rights to their own citizens to claim that britain is doing the same  as the former attorney general  the right hon  and learned member for beaconsfield  mr grieve   eloquently pointed out in his speech  of course  the nuances of our debate would be lost on the other side of the world  and britain’s moral authority on the world stage would be severely dented a few days ago  however  the daily telegraph reported that the prime minister did not support any change to the echr  so we have the home secretary saying one thing and the prime minister another  how can we possibly have confidence in what the government are proposing when their position is so confused they have lost sight of a simple point  which might explain why they are so muddled on this matter  the human rights act is a british bill of rights  these are the basic rights that britain wrote and promoted around the world in the post war period   rights that protect ordinary people from the unaccountable power of the state and vested interests look at some of the examples of how those rights have helped people fight injustice  i think of the elderly couple  mr and mrs driscoll  who had lived together as a married couple for 65 years but who were then put in separate care homes by a local authority  they used the human rights act to be brought back together  i also think that if the human rights act had been in place in 1989  the hillsborough families would have had much more ability to challenge the cruel decision of the original inquest to impose a 3 15 cut off time  which prevented them from finding out basic details about what happened to their loved ones one can only surmise that the government’s purpose in legislating in this area would be to water down the rights in the human rights act and to add more qualifications  i ask the home secretary  how is that going to build a stronger and fairer country  it will not do so  and that is why labour will proudly defend its human rights act and fight any attempt to weaken human rights laws in this country similarly  i struggle to see how the proposed counter extremism bill will do anything other than undermine community cohesion  i would be the first to say that the government are right to want to tackle extremism  and i support them in that aim  however  the question is not whether we do it  but how we do it  i am genuinely concerned that the government are getting their approach drastically wrong  my right hon  and learned friend the member for camberwell and peckham  ms harman  was at her best on this subject today  i say this not out of party politics nor a desire to score points  but because i am worried about the deep despondency caused by the existing legislation  as i hear in the muslim community  when i visit mosques and madrassahs  if the house legislates in haste once again  the damage could be profound at the weekend  the home secretary received a letter from police representatives  faith groups and civil society organisations expressing major concerns about the proposed bill  she cannot just ignore this and plough on regardless  the prevent duty to report extremist behaviour is creating a feeling that the muslim community is unfairly targeted and monitored  it is building a climate of suspicion and distrust  in my view  if the government legislate further and extend what is perceived to be an illiberal and discriminatory approach  far from tackling extremism  they will risk creating the conditions for it to flourish 
the way to address the hon  gentleman’s point is not to tar everybody with the same brush and throw suspicion on the whole community  that is the language we have heard from conservative members  we have heard the prime minister say that parts of the muslim community are “quietly condoning” extremism  that does not win hearts and minds in the community  and we need 99 9  of people to work with the government to find the very small number of people who may be at risk of radicalisation rather than compounding the damage by legislating in haste  i urge ministers to take a step back and to set up a cross party review of how the statutory duty is working in practice  that would be much more beneficial than pushing on with further legislation 
the right hon  gentleman makes an important point  that is why it is important to step with great care into the space that the bill proposes to tread into  talk of gagging orders and closure orders will be perceived as an attack on the whole community  that is how people in this country feel right now  there is no difference between those of us on either side of the house  we want to tackle extremism and radicalisation in the most effective way  i simply put it to the government that they are not achieving that at the moment britain must remain a place where everybody is free to express and develop their beliefs without the fear of being spied on  that freedom is what makes this country a wonderful place to live and worship in  and we must  never lose it  at the same time  we must be steadfast in fighting all forms of extremism   including islamophobia  anti semitism and far right extremism   to prevent any suggestion that extremism is the preserve of just one community let me touch briefly on prisons  we welcome the government’s efforts to reform and modernise our prison system  with a greater focus on rehabilitation and prisoner education  it was a pleasure to hear the right hon  and learned member for rushcliffe  mr clarke  speak on that topic  however  there is a real issue with our prisons  the former chief inspector of prisons  nick hardwick  has talked of prisons being in their worst state for 10 years and as“places of violence  squalor and idleness ”my hon  friend the member for st helens south and whiston  marie rimmer  spoke very powerfully about prison safety and the need to improve staffing numbers  i hope the government listen to her before they proceed with the prisons bill i will end on a more constructive note  there are two carry over bills in the gracious speech on which it might be possible to build more consensus  as the home secretary knows  we share her goal of putting an updated law on the statute book governing the use of investigatory powers and giving the police and the security services the tools to do their job in the digital age  but we continue to have serious concerns about the bill as currently drafted  as it does not yet contain sufficiently strong safeguards and human rights protections a few weeks ago  i wrote to the home secretary setting out seven issues on which we want significant improvement  yesterday  she wrote to me on two of the issues i highlighted  i have to say that i found her letter extremely encouraging  she gave a commitment in the letter to an independent review of the operational case for the bulk powers  that review was called for in committee by the shadow immigration minister  my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras  keir starmer   it is not only the right thing to do  but could build trust in the whole process  i am pleased that she has agreed in the letter to look at having a review and has approached david anderson qc to lead it  the opposition strongly welcome that development  which we believe will build trust and support behind the bill the second issue that the home secretary has written to me about is our concern about the targeting of trade unions  the opposition have not just concerns but proof that in the past the security services have targeted trade unions  in particular  in the case of the shrewsbury 24  the home secretary’s letter contains a suggestion that she will change the bill to ensure that investigatory powers cannot be used to monitor legitimate trade union activity  that is a major concession   historic  even   and i am certain that it will go a long way to reassuring opposition members  there is still a considerable way to go before the investigatory powers bill becomes acceptable  but this letter shows that the home secretary is listening  which bodes well for the rest of the bill’s passage i will touch briefly on the policing and crime bill  colleagues on all sides of the house will know that i have written to them seeking support for a number of   changes in response to the hillsborough verdict  those include making sure that bereaved families have parity of legal funding at inquests where the police are represented and removing any time limit on misconduct proceedings to prevent retirement from being used as a route to avoid them  i am grateful for the support i have had from colleagues from plaid cymru and the green party  and i urge other parties to offer the same support  the best message we could possibly send to the hillsborough families   this point was made very well by my hon  friend the member for middlesbrough  andy mcdonald    is to come together across the floor of this house to make hillsborough a moment of real change my experience of working with the home secretary on hillsborough is a reminder of the incredible power we in this place have in our hands to change lives for the better when we put differences aside and work as one  but we do not always choose to use that power  i believe that the issues we have discussed today   the promotion of human rights and the eradication of extremism   are bigger than party politics  they are issues on which our most vulnerable communities will look to us to achieve the maximum amount of political consensus  because that in turn will give strength back to those communities  i urge the government to keep that point in mind as they bring their new bills forward 
while i congratulate the hon  member for stone  sir william cash  on securing this question  i hope that he will not be too offended that i do not agree with every word of his opportunistic election broadcast on behalf of the leave campaign  is it not plainly the case that this is not an eu question but a question of the competence  or lack of it  of his government and his home secretary  as last week’s select committee report makes clear  while there has been progress on the deportation of foreign national offenders  it has been too slow does the home secretary agree with what the prime minster told the liaison committee in may  he said that she and the home office “should have done better” on this issue  this is not the first time that the home  secretary has been warned about these failings  in the last parliament  the national audit office found that more than a third of failed removals were the result of factors within the home office’s control  despite that  we now learn that the problem is getting worse  not better  in some areas  the select committee said that it was deeply concerned that there were nearly 6 000 foreign national offenders living in the community   the highest figure since 2012  can the home secretary explain why the figure is so high  how many of those people are still subject to active deportation proceedings  and what is she doing to bring the figure down  she urgently needs to get a grip on the issue does the home secretary agree that it is much easier to do that while remaining part of the european union  and that leaving would make it harder to deport people  is it not the case that the prisoner transfer agreement at least provides a framework to speed up the process and that country to country deals are far harder to achieve  is it not also true that our access to the schengen information system and the european criminal records information system helps us to stop criminals arriving here  and the european arrest warrant means that they can be brought to justice finally  would not the british people be better off listening to the two former met commissioners and other senior police who  at the weekend  said that our membership of the eu helps us to fight crime  rather than to the unpleasant scaremongering of the leave campaign 
labour has taken a responsible and pragmatic approach to this bill  we have supported the principle of a modern legal framework governing the use of investigatory powers  recognising that as communications have migrated online  the police  and security services have lost capability  but equally  we know that much stronger safeguards are needed in law to protect individuals from the abuse of state power  that is the balance we have been trying to achieve following second reading  i wrote to the home secretary setting out labour’s seven substantial areas of concern  and i said that unless there was significant movement from the government in those areas  we would be unable to support moves to put this bill on the statute book by the december deadline  the group of amendments before us covers three of those seven issues  the double lock process and the test to be applied by judicial commissioners  the protections for sensitive professions  and the position of trade unions with respect to this bill  i will discuss each of those issues in turn  but i start by raising an issue that emerged in committee my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras  keir starmer   the shadow immigration minister  identified a potential loophole that allowed warrants to be modified after initial approval without proper scrutiny by judicial commissioners  thereby undermining the double lock  the government have part closed this loophole for sensitive professions  but we feel they need to go further and close it for everyone  to ensure that people cannot be added to thematic warrants by modification without the involvement of a judge  i hope that ministers will listen to that concern and reassure us that they are open to further discussion i know that the judicial review test and the double lock have been discussed today  so i will not detain the house long  as members on both sides of the house know  one of our earliest demands was that there should be independent judicial oversight of the approval of warrants  and we were pleased when the home secretary conceded that point some months ago  labour has always believed that the judicial commissioner must be able to consider the substance of the home secretary’s decision to issue a warrant  not just the process  put simply  it must be a double lock  not a rubber stamp my hon  and learned friend has done painstaking work on this issue in committee and outside  and we thank in particular the minister for security for his willingness to listen to our concerns and for the manuscript amendment tabled today by the home secretary  it accepts the spirit of the proposals we tabled in committee by ensuring that judicial commissioners will have to take into account their duties under the overarching privacy clause when reviewing the home secretary’s decision to grant a warrant  judicial commissioners’ decisions must therefore be taken in line with human rights concerns  they must consider whether the same result could have been achieved by other means  and whether public interest concerns are met  in short  it will require much closer scrutiny of the initial decision of the home secretary and  significantly  bring greater clarity than the government’s initial judicial review test would have done  we believe that that does indeed amount to a real double lock and  i have to say  a real victory for the opposition  i confirm that we will support the government’s amendment tonight when we talk about protections for sensitive professions    lawyers  journalists and members of parliament   it might sound to anyone watching this debate as though we in this house were once again seeking special status for ourselves in the eyes of the law  that is why it is important that i emphasise that these are not special  privileges or protections for members of parliament  but protections for members of the public  if someone seeks the help of an mp at a constituency advice surgery or of a lawyer  or blows the whistle to a journalist  they should be able to do so with a high degree of confidence that the conversation is confidential 
the hon  gentleman makes a tremendously important point very well  this is about a basic protection for the public   a safeguard for the public  also  on mps and the wilson doctrine  it is also a protection for our democracy that people can seek the advice of a member of parliament without fearing that someone else is listening  the hon  gentleman is spot on  but i have to say that we do not feel that the bill as it stands provides sufficient reassurance to the public that that confidentiality will be mostly respected  to be fair  the government have moved on this point  but we believe that further work is needed  and that they need to continue to talk to the professional representative bodies  i will take each group in turn  starting with mps we believe that the bill is the right place to codify the thrust of the wilson doctrine  but in our letter to the home secretary we expressed concern that the bill required only that the prime minister be consulted before investigatory powers were used against mps  we argued that the prime minister should personally be asked to approve any such action  and we are pleased that the government have accepted this  i note that the joint committee on human rights  chaired by my right hon  and learned friend the member for camberwell and peckham  ms harman   has proposed a further strengthening of the doctrine and a role for the speaker  who should be notified and able to challenge a decision on intercepting the communications of a member of parliament  we have not yet taken a view on that proposal  it is right to debate it as the bill progresses to the lords  and perhaps we can return to it later 
that is a fair point  and the amendment tabled by my right hon  and learned friend the member for camberwell and peckham seeks to ensure that  perhaps this is an issue that the government need to think about  of course the provisions should apply to members of the scottish parliament  the welsh assembly and the northern ireland assembly  the point made by the hon  and learned member for edinburgh south west  joanna cherry  should be accepted on journalists and journalistic sources  we welcome the fact that the government have moved to put protections originally in the codes underpinning the bill into the measure itself  we note  however  that the national union of journalists believes that wider protections are still needed  and the government should continue to work with it to get that right finally  on legal privilege there has been the least progress of all  serious concerns have been expressed by the bar council and the law society about the fact that the provisions would weaken privacy protections currently enjoyed by lawyers  but those concerns are not adequately reflected in the bill  it is disappointing that ministers have yet to meet the legal bodies    interruption   i did not quite hear what the solicitor general said  i am happy to give way if he wants to clarify the position 
my mistake  i did hear the solicitor general say that he was meeting those bodies this week  it is a little disappointing   i am not making a petty point   as we wish we could have made more progress before this debate  as the right hon  member for haltemprice and howden  mr davis  said  this is extremely important  and our debates would be improved if there had been more progress in this area  nevertheless  it is clear that this is firmly on the solicitor general’s radar  and the excellent points made by the hon  member for bromley and chislehurst  robert neill  show that there is concern in all parts of the house about moving further to get this right  in the absence of acceptable government amendments  amendments 139 to 141 tabled by my right hon  and learned friend the member for camberwell and peckham are a step in the right direction  if amendments were forthcoming from the government  we would certainly support them 
i do not know whether that was a compliment  but i will take it as such  the right hon  gentleman raises an important point  to be fair to the government  there has been movement on thematic warrants  if an mp or a journalist was to be added to a thematic warrant  there would be a judicial oversight process  the right hon  gentleman mentions taking that principle even further and relating it to bulk data  i think that david anderson would need to consider how practically possible that would be  but the right hon  gentleman’s point needs to be considered labour amendment 262 relates to trade unions and would amend clause 18 to ensure  in statute  that undertaking legitimate trade union activities is never in future a reason for the security services or police using investigatory powers  in recent times  we have been shining a light on this country’s past and learning more about how we have been governed and policed  revelations about bloody sunday  hillsborough  phone hacking  child sexual exploitation and other matters have all in different ways shaken people’s faith in the institutions that are there to protect us  they raise profound questions about the relationship between the state and the individual  confronted with those uncomfortable truths about abuses of power  this house needs to provide a proper response and legislate to prevent them in the future  we need to redress the balance in favour of ordinary people and away from the executive 
i will indeed pay tribute to unite  gmb and ucatt  which  in the past couple of months  have reached out of court settlements on blacklisting   a major and historic victory on their part  i will come on to explain the prime concern behind the opposition’s amendment  and the case that most justifies our bringing it forward in the past  the actions of some in senior positions in politics and in the police have unfairly tarnished the reputation of today’s services and today’s policemen and women  that is precisely why it is crucial that we continue to open up on the past  transparency is the best way of preventing lingering suspicions about past conduct from contaminating trust in today’s services  and it will help us to create a modern legal framework that better protects our essential freedoms  human rights and privacy one such freedom essential to the health of our democracy is trade union activity  historically  trade unions have played a crucial role in protecting ordinary people from the abuses of governments and mighty corporations  it is that crucial role  and the freedom of every citizen in this land to benefit from that protection  that amendment 262 seeks to enshrine in law  there will be those who claim that it is unnecessary and the product of conspiracy theorists  but i have received confirmation from the security services that  in the past   under governments of both colours  it has to be said   trade unions have indeed been monitored  in the cold war  there may well have been grounds for fears that british trade unions were being infiltrated by foreign powers trying to subvert our democracy  that helps to explain the wariness of many labour members about legislation of this kind  outside the security services  it seems that some activity went way beyond that  there is  clear evidence that such monitoring was used for unjustified political and commercial reasons  breaching privacy and basic human rights  i mentioned the case of the shrewsbury 24 on second reading  and i remain of the view that that is an outstanding injustice that needs to be settled as my hon  friend the member for liverpool  walton  steve rotheram  anticipated  however  i want tonight to focus on the blacklisting of construction workers  which clearly illustrates the necessity of the amendment we have tabled  we have seen the settlement of claims  as i have mentioned  against companies such as carillion  balfour beatty  costain  keir  laing o’rourke  sir robert mcalpine  skanska uk and vinci  it has now been proven that those companies subscribed to central lists of workers that contained information on their political views and trade union activities  those lists were used to vet people and deny them work  that affected the livelihoods of hundreds of people  and it was an outrageous denial of their basic human rights by seeking an out of court settlement  it would seem that the companies concerned are trying to limit reputational damage  but i do not think that the matter can be allowed to rest there  we need to understand how covertly gained police information came into the hands of a shady organisation called the consulting association  which compiled and managed the blacklist 
that is certainly one way of addressing the concerns that i am putting on record tonight  but another would be to have a separate inquiry into blacklisting per se  not only was it outrageous  but it is still largely not known about  most people outside trade union circles do not know that it happened  that is why  by one means or another  there needs to be a process of inquiry about it we would not know about the practice were it not for the outstanding work of the blacklist support group and individuals such as dave smith who have exposed how much of the information held on individuals appeared to emanate from police sources  for instance  the files hold detailed descriptions of the movements of a number of people at the june 1999 demonstration “carnival against capital”  as a guardian article by dave smith and phil chamberlain pointed out  it seems highly unlikely that that intelligence was the product of a site manager who just happened to be passing through london on that day the blacklist support group referred the matter to the independent police complaints commission in 2012  i want to put on record what it found  because it is pretty shocking  having looked into the concerns  the ipcc wrote in a letter to the blacklist support group “the scoping also identified that it was likely that all special branches were involved in providing information about potential employees who were suspected of being involved in subversive activity ”all special branches were likely to have given information that was used to compile the blacklist 
my hon  friend is absolutely right  those were people who were trying to protect their workmates and colleagues  an individual who protested outside fiddler’s ferry power station near us in the north west was trying to safeguard people’s safety at work  but they were subjected to this outrageous abuse of their rights 
i agree with my right hon  friend  it is quite clear that “all special branches” provided information  there it is in the letter from the ipcc in 2013  i do not think that its pretty astounding confirmation has been properly followed up  as i said in response to the right hon  member for orkney and shetland  mr carmichael   people have a right to know what information was passed by whom in the police service  who sanctioned the passing of that information to such organisations and the policy under which passing that information was justified this is yet another scandal from our country’s past  in which it seems that the establishment rode roughshod over the rights of ordinary people  i pay tribute to the home secretary for the courage she has shown in facing up to our past  but the evidence trail has not yet reached its end  this process must continue  we must continue to go wherever the evidence takes us  such evidence is now taking us to blacklisting and  of course  to orgreave and its aftermath  in my view  the case for inquiries into both is unanswerable  i again call on the government to initiate those inquiries so that people can have the truth for tonight  we call on the government to accept labour’s amendment to provide protection in law for legitimate trade union activity  had that provision been in place years ago  it could have prevented the abuses that we saw with the blacklisting of workers  if it could be agreed  such an historic move would give some recognition to the long and proud campaign for fairness in the eyes of the law that has been fought by trade unionists  it would also show a real willingness on the part of the government to create a modern law that is as much about protecting the rights of the working person as it is about keeping us safe in the 21st century 
the minister’s comments at the dispatch box will have given hope to thousands of trade unionists in this country  their legitimate role has been properly recognised by him at the dispatch box   long may that spirit continue from the government benches 
this final group of amendments covers three of the seven substantial concerns that i set out in a letter to the home secretary after second reading  first  protection of journalistic material and sources  secondly  the definition of internet connection records  and the threshold for their use  and thirdly  the independent review of the operational case for bulk powers  let me take each in turn i will deal with journalistic material and the protection of sources briefly  as the matter was debated at length yesterday  protecting the ability of whistleblowers in private or public sector organisations to speak to journalists without fear of identification is one of the important checks and balances on state and corporate power  many journalists and the national union of journalists have real concerns that clause 68 weakens the existing protections in law for journalistic sources operated under the police and criminal evidence act 1984  they point to an incident in 2014 when police secretly accessed the mobile phone records and call data from a national newspaper  bypassing the pace protections  rightly  there are now worries that that has set a new precedent  furthermore  they feel that the bill might be about to enshrine that new precedent in law under pace  journalists are notified when the authorities want to access material and sources  so that they have the ability to challenge that in open court  the worry is that the bill removes those protections  the national union of journalists makes the point that there is no real difference between physical notebooks and communications data held electronically  both could reveal the identity of a source  labour shares those concerns  they were ably raised by my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras  keir starmer  in committee  and they were also raised on second reading the government have gone some way towards addressing our concerns  tabling amendments 51 and 52  which we welcome  the amendments will ensure that judicial commissioners  when considering a warrant  must give weight to the overriding public interest in a warrant being granted for the use of investigatory powers against journalists and that they must ensure that that is in keeping with wider and more general privacy points  that is a significant move  it takes points that would otherwise have been in codes underpinning the bill and puts them on the face of the bill labour will accept these amendments  but we will do so while being clear that they do not go far enough  indeed  they cover only the award of warrants  not  general access to communications data  we therefore support the amendments tabled by my right hon  and learned friend the member for camberwell and peckham  ms harman  on behalf of the joint committee on human rights   amendments 143 to 145   which seek to extend the same level of protection to journalists as is currently the case under pace we accept that this is a difficult area to get right  particularly when the definition of who is and who is not a journalist is changing in the digital world  we accept the difficulty facing ministers  however  we think that the general principle  enshrined in pace  of allowing journalists to challenge in open court any attempt to access material that could reveal sources is a good one  it would allow those public interest arguments to be heard and tested in court  we hope that the government will today commit to working with us and the nuj to find a wording that in the end does the job 
i am grateful for what the minister has said  it must be possible to find a definition that excludes casual or voluntary bloggers from individuals who make their living from writing or who work for organisations regulated by the independent press standards organisation or other regulators 
i made a similar point yesterday  when i said that it would have been helpful had we made more progress on these issues  and perhaps i can push the minister on this  because i know he is meeting the law society and the bar council later this week the truth is that this raises quite complex issues  with all three professions  a slightly different set of issues arises  and we should not rush to legislate  we should move on the basis that we know what we are trying to achieve  which is to protect the ability of the public to go to an mp without fearing that there is any compromise on a private discussion  we want legal privilege   the privilege that belongs to the client   to be protected  we also want journalists to be able to protect their sources  as they want to do  if we work with the government on that basis in good faith  i believe that we will be able to come to the right position 
the right hon  gentleman makes an important point  which i saw was accepted on the government front bench  he has tabled a detailed amendment on this issue  and he is right to do so and to press the government on this  all of us have to apply our minds to getting these definitions right for all three professions  there is still an open question  as we discussed yesterday  about members of parliament and the right level of scrutiny for any warrant against them  but there is equally more work to do on other fronts we should not pass a bill that weakens these professions   as i said yesterday  this is not about preserving the special status of the individuals who work in them  but about protecting the public and their ability to raise issues through those individuals 
i very much appreciate what the minister has said  i think that any colleague in any part of the house who has read the nuj’s briefing for today’s debate will struggle to disagree with anything in it  if we want this bill to leave parliament with a high degree of consensus across society  it is right that these professional bodies feel  in the end  that the bill is something they can support  that is a prize worth working for  given his comments  i get the feeling that the minister agrees let me turn to the area where i have the greatest anxiety  and on which i am looking for considerable comfort from the government   internet connection records  the hon  member for stevenage  stephen mcpartland  made some strong points about the bodies that can access them  and i would certainly want to support him in his endeavours in that direction  i want to raise issues relating to the definition of internet connection records and the threshold for their use when the home secretary introduced her draft bill in a statement to this house in november  she correctly said that icrs would cover sites visited  not pages looked at  but then went on to say that the icr“is simply the modern equivalent of an itemised phone bill ”     official report  4 november 2015  vol  601  c  970  in my view  that comparison is neither helpful nor accurate  if a person’s itemised phone bill were to be leaked  it would not make a great deal of sense  and to most eyes it would simply be a jumble of numbers  but if an icr were to be leaked  it would reveal a lot more  personal information that could potentially be used against people  icrs therefore need a higher standard of protection than ordinary communications data i recognise that in a world where voice conversations over the phone are becoming less common  there is a need to move in this direction and allow the authorities to hold different forms of information  in order to deal with the changing nature of crime  police and security services need to have new tools at their disposal  and clearly the icr is one such tool  it is also the case that information of this kind can prove vital in locating missing children in the crucial early hours of their disappearance  however  there is still a lack of clarity about what exactly can and cannot be included in an icr  and a risk that if that is not clearly spelled out  there could be drift over the years   they could change and mutate  and become much intrusive  as they are a new construct  it would help to build public trust if the bill contained a clear definition of icrs and what they can include the government’s position is that the draft code of practice makes it clear that urls are not communications data and therefore  by definition  cannot be included  that is helpful to some degree  but it is not the same as having a single  clear definition in one place in the bill  our amendment 293 simply states that an icr cannot include content  that is consistent with the position that ministers have outlined throughout the bill’s passage  such an amendment would remove any lingering ambiguity  i urge the government to accept it  or at least to commit to tabling one of their own that achieves the same thing having made that point about the definition of internet connection records  i now wish to make it clear that my concern is less with the holding of data and more with the criteria under which they can be accessed  in general  communications data should not be capable of being accessed to investigate any crime  regardless of how serious the offence is and the impact on victims  for instance  we cannot justify intrusive powers for a minor driving offence  low level antisocial behaviour or failure to pay a fine  but that  in effect  is what the bill as drafted permits  there should be a clear and simple threshold for the use of communications data   namely  serious crime punishable by at least six months in prison  or crime where significant mental or physical harm could be caused  as i said  given the more intrusive nature of internet connection records  the threshold for their use should be even higher than that i understand the complexity inherent in getting the definition of that threshold right  i would not wish to rule out the use of internet connection records for cases involving online grooming  the sending of sexual communications to a child  online fraud or the location of a missing or suicidal child  i think we would all say that internet connection records should be used for those purposes  as the home secretary said in her response to my letter  but we need to agree a definition of serious crime that captures those activities without widening the net too much and allowing icrs to be used in connection with the investigation of much more trivial offences today  i am looking for an agreement in principle with the spirit of what i am saying  that there should be a general serious crime test for comms data and a higher threshold on top of that for the use of internet connection  records  i will listen carefully to what the minister has to say on that  but unless i am satisfied  i am prepared to press our more general amendments to a vote 
i said at the start that i was looking for considerable comfort  and i think i have just received it from what the minister has said  to be clear  i was saying that there should be a threshold of six months for the use of communications data  and a higher threshold on top of that for internet connection records  as the minister just acknowledged  there is a qualitative difference between the two  if that is what we are agreeing  and if we are also agreeing that there should be no restriction on the use of internet connection records for the other serious purposes that i have outlined  the opposition can probably move forward on that basis without pressing our amendments to a vote this is the area in which the bill has the ability to lose public trust if we do not get it right  because it could affect every single citizen in the land  i am sure that as constituency mps many of us have dealt with situations where an individual falls out with the police at a local level  and they perceive that they are being investigated for all kinds of things and that all aspects of their lives might be turned upside down  we have to put in place appropriate protections that would not allow personal information to be handed over freely in relation to more trivial offences 
i am grateful to the hon  lady for making a point that will enable me to be absolutely clear about what i am saying  i am not arguing against the retention of the data  as i think i made clear at the beginning  i am not arguing against icrs per se  i acknowledge that they could be a very important tool  in an age when communications have migrated online and people have fewer voice telephone calls  this information  could be crucial in detecting serious crime  i am saying that while we should legislate to allow the data to be held  we must also legislate to put in place a very precise threshold  so that the circumstances in which those data can be accessed are explicitly clear  there is not a broad reasonableness or necessity test  what i am saying is that we need a very clear definition of what level of crime permits the authorities to access those records i believe that if we find that definition   i feel that the minister has given a commitment that we will get it   it will enhance public trust in this legislation  in my view  it will knock out completely that lazy label of “snoopers charter”  that is why it is so important that the government nail this point before the bill concludes its passage 
we have learned to admire the minister greatly through this process  and we have learned that when he says something  it happens  i am reassured by the words that he has just put on the record if it helps   perhaps it does not  but i will say it anyway   i would favour quite a high test for icrs  and significantly higher than six months  alongside that  it might be possible to itemise the other individual occasions on which they could be used  be it online grooming or missing persons  the danger with trying to capture it all in a single time period is that we might open the net to other offences that we would not want to be included  i fully acknowledge that this is a complex area  that is why i want to give the ministers leeway to see whether  working with us  they can find the right definition 
the review is clearly a good idea  but it is also a good idea to tighten the definition and the threshold now  because we need to ensure that there is a degree of public confidence in what is being done here  i fully accept that the review is important  the point is that although icrs in themselves may not necessarily  solve a crime  they may let the authorities know where to go to ask for more intrusive information  they will identify the app  service or whatever it is that is being used  which might allow further lines of inquiry i would not be casual about this point   not that i am suggesting the hon  gentleman was being so  if we were to publish somebody’s 12 month website visiting record  which effectively is what an icr is  it would reveal a large amount of information about them  it would give a pretty decent profile of what kind of person they were and some of the information could be highly personal  that is why i say that we need to legislate with great care in this area if we are to carry the public with us 
i will certainly take the right hon  and learned gentleman’s points into account  he is making the same case as we are in our amendments  to be clear  those amendments would create a general seriousness test for all communications data collection  which would have to be passed before any of those data could be released  the test created by my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras  keir starmer  in amendment 292 relates to offences for which the sentence is imprisonment for more than six months  we felt that that was proportionate  it begins to meet some of the right hon  and learned gentleman’s concerns  as it would knock out some of the lower level offences he has just described given what the minister has said  i do not intend to press that amendment to a vote  but it is the bottom line from where we start  on top of the general six months test for all communications data  we want a higher threshold for the more personal data in an internet connection record  i am glad that the right hon  and learned gentleman intervened because we have now made that explicitly clear to the house i turn now to the independent review of the operational case for bulk powers  which allows me to finish on a more positive note  all the bulk powers in the bill   bulk interception  bulk equipment interference  bulk acquisition  bulk personal datasets   give rise to privacy concerns  because of the more indiscriminate way in which they might be used  that is why it is important that they are granted on the basis of what is strictly needed rather than what it would be helpful to have  a point made by the intelligence and security committee in its extremely valuable report  the joint committee on the draft bill also recommended that there should be an independent review of the bulk powers  it was a point upon which i laid great emphasis in my letter to the home secretary  and my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras has done the same throughout the passage of the bill we are extremely pleased that the government have agreed to that request  we agree that david anderson  the independent reviewer  is the right person to lead the review  i understand that  following correspondence between my hon  and learned friend and the security minister  terms of reference have now been agreed and the review can start in earnest  it will be concluded in time to inform proceedings in the other place  crucially  it will consider the necessity of the powers and whether the same result could have been achieved through alternative methods  it will also have a balance of security expertise and human rights expertise  this is a significant move by the government and will ultimately help build public trust in the bill to hark back briefly to the debate on the last group of amendments  it is too early to say what we will do on the back of the review  we will have to see what it concludes  but our working assumption is that it will be incumbent on members on all sides of the house to respond to the review and if necessary reassess their position on the back of it 
there is an exchange of letters between the security minister and my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras  which i hope is in the public domain  and which i believe allays the fears of the right hon  member for orkney and shetland  mr carmichael   to be clear  it was a sticking point for labour that the review had to consider necessity and not just utility  that is enshrined in the terms of reference  so i hope i can reassure him on that point clearly  there is further to go on journalistic material and internet connection records  although it appears from what the minister has said this afternoon that we are heading in the right direction  i stress again that progress on the icr points that i have made are a personal red line that said  i thank the home secretary  the solicitor general and the security minister for the constructive way in which they have approached our discussions  because of the consensus we have been able to find  the legislation is more likely to succeed and to stand the test of time 
i am listening carefully to what the hon  gentleman is saying  and he is obviously aiming some of his comments in labour’s direction  in a world where people are making fewer voice telephone calls   and if he is proposing that he would not want to collect this data   how would he propose the authorities go about locating a missing child in the early hours after the disappearance 
i was first elected to the house 15 years ago to this very day  in that time  debates on security and privacy have produced some of the most fractious exchanges i have seen  it is treacherous territory littered with past failure  too often  such debates are pitched as a clash between two absolutes of privacy and security  where there can be no compromise and only one winner   witness the apple versus fbi debate in the us i have always started from the point that people should not be forced to choose between the two  we all have an interest in maximising both our personal privacy and our collective security  we have to work to find the best point of balance between the two  over the past three months  this house has got closer to finding that balance than ever before  we have elevated the debate above simplistic loyalties to the security or privacy lobbies  as a result  we are now significantly closer to developing the balanced  modern  world leading framework  which the home secretary spoke about  for the use of investigatory powers that this country needs in the digital age i echo the thanks the home secretary gave to right hon  and hon  members of this house and its various committees  all members who have contributed in the past two days  the members of the public bill committee  the chairs of that committee  the hon  member for mid bedfordshire  nadine dorries  and my hon  friend the member for ynys môn  albert owen   and the clerks and the public bill office for overseeing such a high quality process the bill leaves this house in a much better state than we found it  that is due in no small part to the forensic mind and engaging approach of my hon  and learned friend the member for holborn and st pancras  keir starmer   by setting out clearly after second reading our seven substantial concerns  we have been able to bring a focus to this debate that i think has been to the benefit of this house  i am pleased to say that we have secured major commitments on all seven concerns  in particular on bulk powers  the independent review  the privacy clause  judicial oversight and the double lock  and trade unions  thanks to the constructive work of labour  there are stronger safeguards in the bill that protect people’s privacy and their human rights  i say this to those who might be planning to vote against the bill tonight  a vote against it is to deny people those safeguards and to leave on the statute book a much weaker piece of legislation that does not afford those protections our consideration has also been helped by the way in which we  as a country  continue to shine a light on some of the darkest chapters in our past  we continue to learn of instances where the power of the state has  been unfairly used against ordinary people  by being prepared to open up about that and be honest about how we were governed and policed in the past  i believe we are now beginning to make better legislation in the present  i pay tribute to the home secretary for the courage she has shown in being prepared to do that  but i say again that she should be prepared to carry on going wherever that evidence takes us  following the hillsborough verdict  i believe that that trail now leads very firmly to orgreave  and  following the court settlement last month  to blacklisting i will continue to press the home secretary on those matters  but i congratulate her on how she and her ministers have handled discussions on the bill  the security minister  or brother hayes as we might now call him after his starring role in today’s papers  has brought all his considerable experience and personality to bear in moving the bill forward  it is all the better for it  although he probably does not want me to mention him  i feel the need to mention the hon  member for brighton  kemptown  simon kirby   who has been the most helpful government whip i have ever come across let me be clear  the bill is not there yet  we need further changes on internet connection records   the home secretary alluded to that   and on the protection of journalists and their sources  and on legal privilege  however  if the government continue with the same approach as the one they have adopted in recent weeks  i have every confidence that we will get there  we must do that for those who depend on the bill we are debating  the police and security services do incredibly difficult work on our behalf and we thank them for it  their job has got harder as both the level of the threat has risen and the nature of communication has changed in the modern world  to fail to respond to that would be a dereliction of our duties to them  it would also fail our constituents  the bill is ultimately about their safety  the safety of their families and their privacy  i think we can look ourselves in the mirror tomorrow and say we have done our level best to maximise both 
the right hon  gentleman seems to be advocating an argument that we can only achieve progress by being oppositional or party political  surely there are occasions when we can do more by working across the house  we have shown that on this issue and on others  such as hillsborough and other past injustices 
the home secretary is right  the terrible scenes of violence in marseille this weekend have soured what should have been a great celebration of football  as ever  the vast majority have been let down by a hard core minority  and their actions are all the more inexcusable given the serious terror threat hanging over the tournament  although  as the home secretary has said  the england fans are not blameless  it is also the case that they were the subject of extreme provocation and that there were severe failings inside the stadium and concerns about policing  given that this is a complex matter and that we need to establish all the facts ahead of the england wales game on thursday  will the home secretary commit to making a fuller statement at her earliest opportunity  to ensure people’s safety and that there is no repeat 
let me turn to hillsborough and mention that i wrote to all parties in the house  asking for their support in making it a moment of real change  one of the reasons that the hillsborough injustice stood for so long was the inadequacy of the original inquest  which imposed the 3 15 pm cut off and at which families had to scrabble around to raise funds for their own legal representation  the truth is that similar injustices are still happening today  bereaved families are all too frequently thrown into courtrooms  raw with grief  to face adversarial questioning from highly paid qcs hired by the police and other public bodies  later today i will put a proposal to this house to create parity of legal funding for families on the simple principle that public money should fund the truth  not the protection of vested interests  will the home secretary say why she is opposing that move and whether she is prepared to work with us to establish that important principle 
the words of my hon  friend the member for cardiff south and penarth  stephen doughty  were powerful and intensely moving  and will reach well beyond this house  i echo everything that he has just said   and indeed that the home secretary has said   in condemning  on behalf of the opposition  this sickening attack  the grief of the friends and families of those who died will be unbearable  and  we send them our deepest sympathy and solidarity at this time this was an act of terrorism that targeted the gay community  as such  it brings back memories of the horrific bombing 17 years ago of the admiral duncan pub in soho  in the heart of london’s gay village  that too targeted innocent people  and today we think of everyone affected by it if yesterday’s attack is eventually linked to daesh  that will raise concerns among the lgbt community here and across the world about their safety  with that in mind  will the home secretary assure the house that the police and security services keep the safety of all communities  but the lgbt community in particular  under review  will she tell us whether she has received any intelligence that something similar might happen here over the weeks ahead  many pride celebrations are planned across the uk  including large scale events in london  brighton and manchester  people will rightly be concerned about the security of those events  they are planned and staffed by volunteers  and most pride organisations pay for security themselves from the funds that they raise  will the home secretary ensure that organisers receive updated advice  support and  where necessary  additional security  to provide reassurance that pride events will be as safe as possible for all those attending this year it seems to be a facet of our times that rising hate  discrimination and inflammatory language are re entering political discourse  will the home secretary say whether she has seen a poster circulated this afternoon by leave eu  which sought to use events in orlando for its own purposes  will she join me in condemning that highly offensive piece of propaganda terrorists want to divide our communities  and turn one set of people against another  let everyone in this house say to them today that we will never  ever let them succeed in inciting hatred against the muslim community or the lgbt community  we celebrate diversity and community in this country  we will not allow the haters and terrorists to foment division  whatever it takes  we stand resolutely alongside the lgbt community and continue to fight hate and homophobia in all their forms 
i would like to begin by agreeing with the minister that some good progress has been made in the course of our deliberations on the bill  there have been improvements  which we will discuss later  on tackling child sexual exploitation and on the police bail regime   particularly as it applies to those suspected of being involved in terrorism activity  as he has just indicated  there has also been progress on police misconduct  which i will come to however  the bill presents an opportunity to do much more to improve police accountability  and that is an opportunity that we in the house now need to grab  today  i want to present a package of proposals that respond to the historic verdict of the hillsborough inquest  which finally concluded  after 27 years  that  as the families had known from day one  the loss of their loved ones was not an accident and they had been unlawfully killed  but that that fact had been covered up for all those years this package seeks to rebalance this country and to make it fairer  it seeks to rebalance it away from the establishment and in favour of ordinary families  it is a package that will stand as a permanent tribute to the dignity and determination of the hillsborough families  knowing them as i do  they would want nothing more than that no other family in the future should go through what they have gone through let me take the house briefly through this package of proposals  new clause 63 would give bereaved families equal funding for legal representation at inquests where the police are involved  it seeks to establish the crucial principle that there should be parity between the two sides  the reason that is important is that it says very clearly that the public interest lies in finding the truth  that is how public resources should be directed  they should not be directed towards creating an unbalanced contest at an inquest  with public money used to protect vested interests in the public sector 
i am grateful to the right hon  gentleman for his support  he is absolutely right  i will come on to explain precisely how this would have helped to even the playing field and give the families the chance to get truth at the first time of asking  the original inquest catastrophically failed on that account  and that needs to be very clearly understood as we consider this amendment amendment 126 seeks to close the long standing loophole of retirement being used by police officers as a route to evade misconduct proceedings  new clause 64 seeks to hold the government to their promise to the victims of press intrusion to hold a second stage inquiry looking at the culture of relations between police and the press  new clause 66 seeks to legislate for a code of practice with regard to the media relations policy of each police force  and to spell out that attributable briefing by police forces  which was so damaging in the case of hillsborough  is not permitted unless it is in the most exceptional circumstances  amendments 127  and 128 seek to strengthen the independent police complaints commission  new clause 67  which will be considered later  seeks to strengthen the offence of misconduct in public office let me start with the area where there is greatest consensus   police misconduct  i listened carefully to what the minister said  and i am grateful for the movement that he indicated to the shadow policing minister  my hon  friend the member for birmingham  erdington  jack dromey   in committee whereby there should not merely be an arbitrary 12 month period after retirement  because  as we know  police wrongdoing may come to light much later  we are glad that the government have indicated that they are prepared to move on this matter in the other place and table an amendment to that effect  while i will not press my amendment to a vote  i would still like to press the minister a little further on this point  he is saying that this should be applied only in the most exceptional circumstances  but that potentially rules out many people who might be guilty of gross misconduct but would not be caught by his “exceptional” test  he needs to reassure the house on this point 
that is a good offer and i thank the minister for it  i think we can move forward on that basis  i hope we all know what we are trying to achieve   that is  if serious wrongdoing comes to light about an individual who is beyond 12 months retired  it must be possible for misconduct or disciplinary proceedings to be initiated against them  our amendment says that there should then also be sanctions that are able to be applied against that individual  i say to the minister that we will want to insist on that point as well if we can agree to move forward on that basis  that is a considerable example of progress that matters greatly to the hillsborough families  who  as they were continuing their 27 year struggle  felt very aggrieved when they saw individuals who had retired on a full pension and who they felt were beyond reach and could not be held to account  i believe that this should apply retrospectively  misconduct is misconduct whenever it occurred  and people should be held to account for their actions 
it was a long intervention  madam deputy speaker  but it was a good one  my hon  friend the member for liverpool  walton  steve rotheram  makes a very important point  i do not think that any attempt is being made to blame ordinary policemen and women  that is not the purpose of the amendment  it is important for me to say very clearly to those police officers who are out there keeping the streets safe that this is not an attack on them  the package is about not allowing the misdeeds of the past to taint the present and those police officers who are working today  that is such a crucial point  because if we do not deal properly with such allegations  we allow the situation to contaminate the present and to corrode trust in today’s police service  none of us in this house wants that  so my hon  friend is absolutely right to make that point  which cannot be stressed enough 
that is right  this is about people who have been guilty of serious misconduct in public office  and it is crucial that they cannot use retirement as a means of evading accountability for that misconduct  the change to which the minister appears to be agreeing closes a long standing loophole and frustration for members of the public  it exposes the police to a considerably more challenging regime  but rightly so  any profession needs to be held accountable to the highest standards  we will work with the minister to get it right  i believe that we can do so  but i stress that this is about upholding the reputation of the vast majority of police officers  who serve the public with distinction the issue of police press relations is the biggest area of unfinished business  although  in fact  we have not even really started to make any changes with respect to putting right the wrongs of hillsborough  as we know  the briefing of the press in those first days after the tragedy caused incalculable harm and damage  not just to the families who had lost loved ones  but to the thousands of people  such as my hon  friend the member for liverpool  walton  who had returned from the match in a state of trauma  only to read a couple of days later that the police were blaming them for the deaths of their friends and family that is why feelings are so strong  not just in merseyside but across the country  it simply cannot be right that a police force is able  unattributably  to brief malicious and unproven information to a newspaper  we need a stronger and more transparent regime for press relations  so that false impressions cannot be put out there with the intention of setting a narrative about a particular incident  families who are fighting for justice often find that it is very difficult to overturn the false version of events  that was certainly the case for the hillsborough families 
i agree on both levels  this was a cover up perpetrated on the record  off the record and in the committee rooms of this house  it went to the very top   even to 10 downing street  where the head of press at the time briefed that a “tanked up mob” caused the disaster  this cover up went to the highest level  what chance did ordinary families have when faced with the might of the establishment seeking to perpetrate a lie on that scale  it has been a 27 year fight  as we now know this whole area is a major piece of unfinished business  and it is why we have suggested new clause 66  i think i heard the minister say that he would work with us  with the college of policing and with the national police chiefs council on new clause 66 to get this right  i believe my hon  friend the shadow policing minister is having some useful discussions with them  they have responded to labour’s initiative in this area and have already begun working on a code of conduct for police press relations  we want to work with the minister to get this absolutely right  because there has been a common thread in a number of injustices down the years  an unhealthy relationship between police and press can sow the seeds for a cover up that is difficult to overturn new clause 64 invites the house to reinforce the promise made by the prime minister to the victims of press intrusion  let me go back to what the prime minister said in november 2012 “when i set up the inquiry ”   the leveson inquiry   “i also said that there would be a second part to investigate wrongdoing in the press and the police…we remain committed to the inquiry as it was first established ”     official report  29 november 2012  vol  554  c  446  he also said “it is right that it should go ahead  and that is fully our intention ”     official report  29 november 2012  vol  554  c  458  it has been put to me that that promise was made face to face with some of the victims of hacking and press intrusion   people such as the mccanns and milly dowler’s family  it seems to labour members as though the government have subtly shifted their position in the intervening years  as we heard a moment ago from the minister  it is no longer a question of when the inquiry will go ahead  it is a question of whether it will go ahead  the government now say that following the conclusion of the outstanding investigations on the matter  they will take a decision on whether the second stage of the inquiry will go ahead 
i wholeheartedly agree with my right hon  friend  there is a huge amount of unfinished business  these issues are present in so many of the injustices that we have seen  where there has been inappropriate contact between police and press  we await the conclusions of the daniel morgan panel  for instance  which might best illustrate some of these issues that is true of other events as well  we remember the way in which the media were manipulated in the case of the shrewsbury 24  for example  there have been many examples of this over time  indeed  part 1 of the leveson inquiry found unhealthy links between senior met officers and newspaper executives  which led to the resignation of the then met police chief and others  the issue cannot be left there  public officials and police officers have also been convicted of offences related to these matters the minister really needs to provide an explicit answer on this specific point today  he cannot wriggle out of this commitment  it is not the kind of commitment you can wriggle out of  given everything that those people have been through  a promise should be a promise  when it is made to people who have suffered in the way that many of the victims of press intrusion have suffered  i know that the hillsborough families feel exactly the same  they were the victims of the biggest example of inappropriate police briefing of newspapers   and it was not just one newspaper  people think it was just one newspaper that reported the lies  but many of them reported the lies that were given to whites news agency in sheffield  and those lies went round the world  only this week  i had an email from someone in the united states saying that they were astonished to find out the truth when they watched the recent bbc2 documentary on hillsborough  and that for 27 years they had thought that the events were the result of hooliganism  it is impossible to exaggerate the harm that those lies caused i say to the minister tonight that we need a better answer  if he were to stand up now at the dispatch box and say clearly to the house that there will be a second stage inquiry into the culture of relations between the police and the press  i would be the first to say that we would not press our new clause 64 to a vote  however  there is growing suspicion among organisations   hacked off  obviously  but others too   and campaigners for justice that they are slowly being let down and that this matter is being slowly slid into the long grass  we have had anonymous briefings from people close to the culture secretary and others in government to suggest that it has already been canned  well  we on the labour benches are not prepared to accept that  so i say clearly to the minister that unless he can provide a much more direct reassurance  we will push the matter to a vote this evening to force the prime minister to honour his own promise   it is not our promise  it is his promise   to the victims of press intrusion and hacking 
i would certainly say so  i cannot understand why there is any doubt about this  given the clarity of the prime minister’s statements  which i have read out  and given that the chair of the home affairs select committee  my right hon  friend the member for leicester east  keith vaz   has just said that the promise was made not only to the victims but to senior parliamentarians  i do not see how this commitment can be negotiable 
well  there you go  that says it all really  the right hon  member for maldon  mr whittingdale  seems to be in a different mode these days  one wonders what deals have been done by the government if they are preparing to unpick this agreement  and we will watch them very carefully the minister makes a fair point that there are ongoing investigations  i take his point that some of the investigations will have a material impact on issues that we are considering  we are not saying that we want the inquiry to start right now  we accept that there are matters to be concluded in the courts before it can proceed  what we are after is the removal of any doubt that it will proceed at the appropriate moment and that the promise the prime minister gave to those victims will be honoured  that is what we are seeking to establish tonight  that is what we are asking the minister to lay down very clearly this goes beyond party politics  the victims and their families have suffered enough  and members on both sides of the house owe it to them to make good on the promise that was given to them  that is why i look forward to members from both sides of the house joining us in the lobby tonight  because it clearly looks as though the government are not going to give way 
my hon  friend puts it very well  that is what i have seen when working with the hillsborough families  as have others when they have been fighting for justice  those people are affected not just by the original trauma they suffered  but by how the system grinds them down afterwards  making them fight for everything  not giving them an inch and slowly draining the life out of them  how cruel is that  it is just wrong   is it not    that the government machine thinks it can operate in that way  as i will move on to say    i spoke today to a family about going to meetings with 14 lawyers sitting around the table and just a couple of family members  that is just not right  we all know it is not right  any of us who have been ministers will have seen that style of meeting  and it is just not right  it is time to change it  we should not make these families fight for everything  but support them  and tip the scales in their favour and away from the powerful  why not do so 
i have a lot of time for the minister  as he knows  but such people are listening to this debate  my hon  friend the member for kingston upon hull north  diana johnson  is not in her place  but if the victims of contaminated blood are listening to this debate  they will immediately recognise what i am saying  if the victims of organophosphates   sheep dip   poisoning are listening today  they will understand what i am saying  if the people waiting for the announcement about the battle of orgreave investigation are listening  they will understand what i am saying  there are so many people who have not been given justice by the system  and that just is not right  it really is not right  and that is why i keep saying that we must make hillsborough a moment of change when we can tip the scales in favour of ordinary families and away from the establishment 
that is a good point  it would be good enough if we got a cast iron commitment  ministers have reintroduced a doubt   in media briefings  they have said  “oh  it probably won’t go ahead now”   and have muddied the waters  if they clarified that tonight  that would be good enough  if they said  “it will go ahead after the proper time has elapsed  given the criminal proceedings that are still outstanding”  that would be fine and everyone would understand it  if they gave that commitment tonight  there would be no need for a vote because we would have done our job  but if they cannot give such a commitment  that would be revealing in itself  if the minister cannot stand at the dispatch box and give such a clear commitment  or rather reaffirm it to the people to whom ministers have already made it  that would be revealing in itself and we would be right to force a vote in those circumstances  in that case  people will not be strung along and left hoping that there will be a leveson 2 one day  we will have forced the issue so that ministers are held to account for their promise  that is what we are doing tonight  ministers have the chance to do the right thing   to stand at the dispatch box and say  “yes  we will do it  we will honour what we said ” if they do not do so  we will ask members of decency and integrity on both sides of the house to stand with us and to go through the lobby with us tonight to hold ministers to account for the promise they made finally  let me turn to our new clause 63 on parity  the new clause seeks to establish the principle of parity of legal funding for bereaved families at inquests involving the police  in introducing it  i want to say that it is very important that people do not see hillsborough as a one off belonging to a bygone era  to be honest  many bereaved families still face a very similar experience when they go to an inquest  they often find themselves pitched into an adversarial and aggressive courtroom when they are still raw with grief  they are unable to match the spending of the police or the public sector in what they spend on their own legal representation  those families find their lives picked apart  they are made to look like they are perpetrators  not victims  that is a very common experience  many people who suffer it do not have the huge support that the hillsborough families had  they are ordinary families battling away on their own  with no one else coming to support them  that is why the principle of parity is so tremendously important 
that is exactly what lies behind the new clause  my right hon  friend has just made my point  we will all have examples from our experience as constituency mps  we know families who have been at inquests that have been highly unsatisfactory experiences  and where they did not get legal support  i will come to a few examples  to show how unfair it is  the public sector spends taxpayers’ money like water on hiring the best qcs to line up in the courtroom and defend its reputation  ordinary families are scrabbling around  re mortgaging their houses and doing whatever they can to try to put up some kind of fight against that  how wrong is that public money should pay to establish the truth  that means that there should be parity between the two sides in that process  it should not be the case that the public sector packs a courtroom with highly paid qcs  that is such an important principle to establish coming out of hillsborough   to be honest  if there is to be one lasting legacy from hillsborough  that should be it  i was tempted by the right hon  member for north norfolk  norman lamb  to make this point before  the hillsborough families were represented by michael mansfield at the recent inquest  if that had been the case back in 1990  as well  there is no chance on god’s  earth that the cruel and inhumane 3 15 pm cut off time would have been allowed to stand  have we ever had a situation in this country before where bereaved families have been told that they cannot have information about what happened to their loved ones in their dying minutes  that was the case here  have we ever had a situation before where only after 27 years are families finally told who gave their loved ones the kiss of life and carried them over the pitch  what an affront to natural justice that is  yet it was allowed to stand  because those families did not have someone who could challenge it a few weeks ago  margaret aspinall  chair of the hillsborough family support group  came to parliament to deliver a very personal reflection on what it was like all those years ago  i am very grateful to all right hon  and hon  members who attended  i am sure they will agree that it was an intensely moving occasion  margaret described the indescribable pain and hurt she felt when she was sent a cheque of just over £1 000  which was supposedly compensation for the life of her son james  she said she had to put it towards the legal fund that the group was asking members to contribute to  in itself that was not enough because she had the cost of travelling to the inquest in sheffield every day  she was living on the breadline and having to borrow money from her family and her mum to make it all work  how can it be right that families in such circumstances  who have not done anything wrong  find themselves in that situation  it cannot be right that they should be scratching  saving and doing all those things  when taxpayers’ money is being paid for the other side to do them down 
that is right  and as has been hinted at  that delay is often used to grind people down even further  it really does not work  and parliament must decide whether we are prepared to let people carry on going through such an entirely unsatisfactory process  i do not think we should in people’s experiences today we can see parallels with those of the hillsborough families  to give a current example  a young boy  zane gbangbola  died in 2014 in the floods in his home in surrey  the family contest that hydrogen cyanide was brought into the house from a former landfill site that had not been properly sealed  it is a high profile case  yet the family have been turned down three times for legal aid  this ordinary family were just going about their business  and all of a sudden their son is dead and mr gbangbola is permanently in a wheelchair  the inquest starts today  and the only reason that the family have quality legal representation is because they were given an anonymous £25 000 donation on friday  that cannot possibly be right 
that is extraordinarily unfair  although this government have made things even more unfair with their cuts to legal aid  people are not getting through and they are not getting funding when they apply in the way that they would have done in the past  they are unrepresented at these inquests  which cannot be right 
the amendment is designed to develop the same effect and to state that there should be parity of legal funding  that is an incentive for the public sector not to spend too much on its own  if it has to fund families as well  that might bring down the legal bill   it might not add any further costs 
we need inquisitorial inquests rather than adversarial inquests  in the case of hillsborough  the lord chief justice made a specific ruling when he quashed the original inquest  he hoped  given that the police had clearly tainted the evidence  that the new inquest would not degenerate into an adversarial battle  but   i am afraid to say   that is exactly what happened  at public expense  one individual in particular  hired to represent the former officers  a mr john beggs  went into the courtroom and repeated all kinds of lies and innuendo about supporters of liverpool football club  my hon  friend the member for north durham  mr jones  and i were there  we witnessed it   and it was a particularly unpleasant thing to witness  it is even more galling to think that we were paying for that it is not just the cost but how people are questioned that is gross and unjust  i will give one final example to illustrate  the house will know that  after a long fight by her family  an inquest was recently held into the death of cheryl james  who died at the deepcut barracks in surrey  the qc acting for surrey police was the same mr john beggs  i know  from speaking to cheryl’s father  that the family were deeply hurt by an intrusive and aggressive line of questioning that focused on several very personal questions  they were particularly hurt by one untrue allegation levelled at them  according to  mr beggs  mr james  in making inquiries to surrey police  had distracted the latter from the milly dowler investigation  can members imagine how he felt when he heard that  in trying to get to the truth about what happened to his daughter  he found himself the subject of an outrageous  appalling slur  which the dowler family  such is their decency  stepped in to correct it should not be like this  it must not be like this  it is well known that police forces are instructed to hire this individual if they feel in a tight sport  and they pay huge amounts of public money to do so  it should not be allowed to carry on  we should call time on it today 
no  it does not  my hon  friend makes a good point  and i cannot see why that should not happen  equally  i cannot see why the government would not accept the bill  proposed by lord wills in another place  to create a national office to support bereaved families so that each family does not have to reinvent the wheel and go through all the learning needed to get ready for an inquest  that is another good proposal to finish  we are seeking to establish a simple principle  in the words of mr james  this is about “parity of arms”   if it has to be like that  if there is to be an adversarial battle in the courtroom  we should at least give bereaved families the same ability as the public sector to defend themselves  that is an unanswerable principle  and i am sorry the government have decided they cannot support it tonight  i know they are saying they are waiting for the conclusion of bishop james’ report  but this is bigger than hillsborough   it is very much evident in hillsborough  but it is much bigger   and concerns a number of families facing a similar injustice today is it not the case that public money should fund the establishment of the truth and  in particular  help people to get to the truth at the first time of asking  so that the truth can be used by public bodies to learn   to look at where they went wrong and see how they can improve  instead  they do the opposite  they go into those courtrooms to defend themselves and reputations  spending large amounts of taxpayers’ money in doing so  i hope that the government would agree with the spirit of what i am saying tonight  if they do  i would hope for a clear commitment this evening that they support the aim of parity of funding for families at inquests  from there  i hope we might be able to move forward  from what i can gather  however  the government have not done enough  and unless the minister is able to provide this level of reassurance  we will press the new clause to a vote we are determined to make hillsborough a moment of real change in this country  it must be a watershed  after which power shifts into the hands of ordinary people and away from those in positions of power  that is what people expect this parliament to do  we cannot  face a 27 year injustice and then feel that we do not have to act or that we can carry on as we were  we cannot  ordinary families are facing injustices today and are being ground down as they battle to get the truth and justice  let us do the right thing  i call on all members to support the package that we are putting forward  let us finally make this a fairer country  in which power is more evenly shared among people from all backgrounds 
the minister has made the position clear  but in doing so he will not have pleased many people who are campaigning for justice for people who have suffered press intrusion  will he be explicit that what he has just outlined is in fact a weakening of the government’s position  a couple of years ago  the prime minister promised that there would be a stage 2  but tonight we are being told that that is now up in the air and up for grabs 
the issue of parity of legal funding at inquests at which the the police are represented goes beyond hillsborough  it affects many families fighting many injustices  it goes beyond the work of bishop james jones  could we at least have a commitment that  the government will work with us to seek that parity and equality of legal funding at inquests  that commitment would mean something 
the fairest thing that we can say about this bill is that it is a decidedly mixed bag  on the one hand it makes improvements to police accountability  but on the other it undermines the independence of the fire service and the police service by allowing volunteers to replace front line staff none the less  the bill leaves this house in a better state than it came to us in  i pay tribute to my shadow ministerial team  my hon  friends the members for birmingham  erdington  jack dromey   for rotherham  sarah champion  and for west ham  lyn brown   all of whom have played an important part in improving the bill  i thank the home secretary and her ministerial team for the constructive way in which they have continued to debate these matters with us  i also thank all members of the bill committee and the chairmen  the member for bury north  mr nuttall  and my right hon  friend the member for knowsley  mr howarth  the bill makes some real improvements  but we still have some concerns  the issues broadly fall into four categories  measures we support  measures we have helped to improve  measures we oppose  and the missed opportunities in the bill  i will go briefly through each on the measures we support  the super complaints system is a genuine step forward  and we congratulate the home secretary on bringing it to the house  we also support the strengthening of the ipcc and of the regulation of the police in general  the ban on the use of police cells for people in mental health crisis is a crucial step forward  but it needs to be matched with a commissioning strategy in the nhs that ensures alternative places of safety for people who will no longer be held in police cells on the measures that we have helped to improve  i pay tribute to my hon  friend the member for rotherham for the work that she has done to strengthen the measures in the bill on child sexual exploitation  and particularly on the licensing regime for private hire vehicles  there are further improvements to come on child abduction warning notices my hon  friend the member for birmingham  erdington  the shadow police minister  pushed the issue of police bail in committee  based on the case of siddhartha dhar  the individual who waltzed out of the country while on bail  i am pleased that the government have responded  although mark rowley said in evidence to the home affairs committee that there should be the very tightest of regimes  whereby people have to surrender passports while they are still in police custody at police stations  i believe that the bill could still be tightened on that point we have had a good exchange today on police misconduct  we welcome the fact that the government have been prepared to extend the 12 month limit for exceptional instances of misconduct  we will work with the home secretary and the minister for policing  fire  criminal justice and victims on getting that right  but that  too  appears to be a genuine step forward there are two main measures that we oppose  first  we believe that the greater use of volunteers in the police service is dangerous in the context of the further cuts being made to police budgets  contrary to what the government promised in the spending review  police services in england and wales are facing real terms cuts to their budgets this year  which will not be backfilled by the local precept  we believe that it is dangerous to impose those cuts without setting out a vision for policing and saying precisely what the boundaries are for what volunteers can and cannot do  and the government need to think again before going down that road on the fire service  my hon  friend the member for west ham made a powerful case that we should not just merge the two services and  in effect  make the fire service the junior partner of the police service  the bill will allow a hostile takeover of a fire service  authorised by the home secretary but over the heads of local people and without their consent  we do not believe that that will strengthen the fire service  which has an important role as a separate statutory service  all the pros and cons of the single employer model have not been fully debated  and we feel that this is a road down which the government should not go because they have failed to make the case for it i will finish with the missed opportunities  i conclude my speech on third reading with a sense that parliament has missed a moment to make some real changes on the back of the historic hillsborough verdict  today  we have debated two issues  first  there should be a principle of equality in legal funding for bereaved families at inquests where police are represented  secondly  we have debated the prime minister’s promise to the victims of press abuse and intrusion that there would be a second stage inquiry into the relationship between the police and the press  on both fronts  we have not made any progress tonight  it was disappointing that the government chose to oppose the measures that we in the opposition proposed representatives of the hillsborough family support group   the chair  margaret aspinall  and sue roberts   were here today  and i can tell the house that they have gone home disappointed and feeling that parliament is already forgetting what their fight was all about  it was a monumental miscarriage of justice that now requires a commensurate response from the house  changes must be made to stop any family in future going through what they have been through  but sadly  families can still go through it  many families continue to go into inquests raw with grief  face aggressive questioning by queen’s counsel hired at great public expense and find the whole experience deeply unsatisfactory it is disappointing that the government were not even able to accept the principle that we should have equal funding  it would have been a step forward if they had been able to do so  i understand that they are asking bishop james jones to look at these matters  but of course  this issue goes much broader than hillsborough  it is about fairness in our criminal justice system  and i believe that the government are missing an opportunity by not acting on it quickly  quite frankly  it is obscene for police forces to continue to spend large amounts of money on hiring aggressive lawyers to challenge families in the way that they do at inquests  this scandal should not be allowed to continue  and we in the opposition will continue to fight against it until there is real change in conclusion  the bill was an opportunity to make this country fairer  to even up the scales and even to tip them in favour of ordinary families and away from the establishment  i fear that we have failed to do that  and it will now be up to the other place to see whether it can make progress  who can vote against the principle of equal funding for bereaved families at inquests  i cannot believe that anyone would actually vote against it  there is a debate about how to achieve it  but i find it very strange indeed that people can really vote against that principle  how can members go through the lobby tonight voting against the prime minister’s commitment to the victims of hacking  press intrusion and abuse  the government have weakened their position tonight  they said before that there would be an inquiry  now they say that there might be an inquiry once outstanding legal matters are concluded  that is not fair to the families who were given a firm promise by the prime minister this is my direct appeal to the other place  vote for equality of legal funding for families  and vote for the honouring of the promise to the victims of press intrusion  in doing so  make hillsborough a moment of real change in this country 
 urgent question   to ask the home secretary to make a statement on the incidents of violence in marseille over the weekend involving england fans at the euro 2016 football tournament 
as the dust settles on a terrible weekend in marseille  attention is turning to security around england’s next game  while england fans were certainly not blameless at the weekend  it is clear that  they were the subject of extreme violence meted out by russian supporters  whatever the rights and wrongs  we cannot afford to see any repeat of that  i am sure we are all agreed on that  but there are real fears that there could be a repeat the chairman of the football association has raised serious concerns in a letter to uefa  he identifies a number of major security lapses in the stadium on saturday  he says that stewarding was poor and segregation insufficient  and that fireworks and flares were taken in and then let off  that is extraordinary  given the heightened security around the tournament  greg dyke also points to a situation where england and russian fans may come face to face again tomorrow in lille  the thousands of people from the three home nations who are out there to enjoy the football will now be worried about their safety  that is why we have brought this urgent question today with respect to the home secretary  she did not provide a full statement on these matters yesterday  can she confirm today exactly how many police are being sent to france and what precisely they will be asked to do  she mentions football banning orders  in 2010  3 174 football banning orders were in place  now  that number is 2 181  why has it dropped so significantly  she says that 1 400 passports were seized in advance of the tournament  but there are over 2 000 banning orders  what happened to the other 600 people whose passports have not been taken on stadium safety  will the government today contact uefa to reinforce the fa’s concerns at a very senior level  will the home secretary ask uefa to investigate claims that russian ultras have links to the official russian delegation on policing  it would appear that some tactics were heavy handed and the indiscriminate use of tear gas added to the general sense of chaos  we accept the sensitivity of policing  but will there be any discussion with the french authorities on policing going forward  will there be any discussions about managing particular flashpoints in lille tomorrow and keeping supporters separate what is needed now more than anything is honesty and cool heads on all sides  many england fans were clearly the victims of violent extremists and poor security  but it is not acceptable to march into someone else’s town singing provocative songs about the second world war and launching bottles at police  ahead of thursday and the rest of the tournament  all sides now need to take a look at themselves and resolve  from hereon in  to make this the festival of football we all want it to be 
may i send our sincere condolences to the victims of yesterday’s appalling attack in istanbul  and send an uncompromising message to the terrorists that they will never prevail i congratulate the minister on her excellent statement to the house  any referendum has the potential to create division in society  and this one was no different  we have probably all felt the rising tension on the streets of our constituencies in recent weeks  in the aftermath  it is incumbent on any elected representative to do three things  first  to respect the decision of the people  secondly  to work to heal these divisions  and  thirdly  to take on directly and defeat the small minority of people who seek to use these moments to peddle hatred and violence  that is what the whole house together should resolve to do today since last thursday  there are reports of a fivefold increase in race hate comment on social media channels  the 57  increase in reported hate crimes  which the minister mentioned  comes on top of an already rising tide of hate crime in england and wales  last year  the police recorded over 50 000 individual hate crimes  most of them racially motivated  which was an 18  rise on the previous year as the minister said  perhaps the most disturbing reports are those of attacks on individuals and specific communities in recent days  in huntingdon  cards have been distributed outside homes and primary schools  saying “no more polish vermin”  in hammersmith  a polish community centre was daubed with racist graffiti  on monday  the guardian reported that a muslim schoolgirl was cornered by a group of people who  told her “get out  we voted leave” there have been reports of more incidents in leicester today  which my hon  friend the member for leicester south  jonathan ashworth  mentioned  yesterday in manchester  footage emerged of a us army veteran and university lecturer being told to “go back to africa” by three youths on a tram  as the minister said  there have been attacks on muslim women  and even reports of women speaking on mobile phones in a foreign language being screamed at in the streets what is happening to the britain we have known  this is not taking our country back  but turning britain into a place we have never ever been  by its very nature  hate crime is a rejection of the british values that have always bound us together  non british nationals living  in britain today will feel worried about their safety and will be in need of reassurance  i hope the minister will be able to provide even more reassurance in her response to my questions i welcome the minister’s promise of a new hate crime action plan  will she tell the house when the plan will be published  because it is urgently needed  people in need of reassurance want it to be given today  so will she confirm what extra steps are being taken to monitor reports of hate crime across the country and what immediate advice the home office is giving to the police on tackling such incidents secondly  it is crucial people know how to report hate crime  the true vision website the minister mentioned is very welcome  but i guess it is not widely known  what action will she take to increase awareness of it  and is there a case for national advertising to promote it thirdly  confidence to report hate crime will increase only if people believe their reports will be taken seriously  there is a feeling that such reports are not always taken seriously  i hear what the minister says about the new cps advice  will she assure the house that it will encourage police and prosecutors to follow up every single report of hate crime  prosecute wherever possible and make sure perpetrators face the full force of the law  to provide further reassurance at this difficult time  will ministers provide more reassurance to people about their immigration status in this country during the renegotiations with the european union  in doing so  will they also inform the wider public about the issue and prevent some of the more ignorant comments from being made to people in the street finally  is there not now a case for a much more proactive strategy to tackle far right extremism  racist activity and violence have been on the rise for some time  as hope not hate has warned  is it not time to take its warnings much more seriously  will the minister tell the house whether the security services are devoting sufficient resources and attention to this growing threat  and will she ask them to review it it is only 10 days ago since we lost our wonderful friend and colleague jo cox  as the dust settles on this referendum  we need to continue to have the words of her husband brendan at the front of our minds “hate doesn’t have a creed  race or religion  it is poisonous ”does the minister not agree that 99  of the british public who voted to leave did not vote for an intolerant  xenophobic or racist britain  do not both sides of the referendum campaign now need to unite to make sure britain remains the open and welcoming place we know and love 
i should probably begin by declaring an interest  my wife  marie france  is a dutch national and our three children are half dutch  so many british families are similar to ours  with relatives born in ireland or in other eu countries  the 3 million or so eu nationals living here are the fathers and mothers  aunties and uncles  and grandmas and granddads of millions of british children  to leave any uncertainty hanging over their right to be here is tantamount to undermining family life in our country  that does not strike me as a very prime ministerial thing to do  but it is what the home secretary did yesterday  she said that“people who have an established life here”would be part of negotiations with brussels  for people making a huge contribution to our society to be talked of as a bargaining chip  as was said  is insensitive to say the least  but when she adds that“nobody necessarily stays anywhere forever” it becomes quite threatening i hope the minister will go back and tell the home secretary that my kids would quite like their mum to stay here forever  if that’s okay with her  in retrospect  does he not accept that the home secretary’s comments were ill judged  is it not the case that people who have made a life here when it was perfectly legal for them to do so should not now have the rug pulled from under them  furthermore  is it not entirely within the gift of the uk government to remove this uncertainty today  why is the home secretary not here today doing precisely that  rather than prioritising her leadership campaign  this is entirely a matter for the uk government to decide  and it is this government’s own decision to make this an issue in the negotiations  by doing so  are they not creating the conditions for the unwelcoming climate to continue  and for the rise in xenophobic and racist abuse we have seen finally  does the very fact that we are having to hold this debate today not illustrate how flawed the referendum campaign was  did people not have a right to know the answer to this crucial question before they went to vote  sending any eu nationals home has enormous implications for families  for public services and for the economy  so why on earth did the government instruct civil servants not to carry out any contingency planning on the implications of brexit  was that not the very height of irresponsibility  and has it not left us with “neither compass nor chart”  as lord hennessey has said  the conservative party has reduced our country to chaos and created uncertainty being felt in every family  if the home secretary wants to be the person to lead us out of it  she needs to have the courage to come to this house and clear up her own mess 
i beg to move that this house notes that there are approximately three million nationals of other eu member states living in the uk  further notes that many more uk nationals are related to nationals of other eu member states  rejects the view that these men  women and children should be used as bargaining chips in negotiations on the uk’s exit from the eu  and calls on the government to commit with urgency to giving eu nationals currently living in the uk the right to remain this debate directly affects the lives of millions of people living in this country  so let me start by inviting the house to join me in sending a very clear message to the eu nationals living in the uk  which i think they need to hear right now from this parliament  you are truly valued members of our society  and you are very welcome here let us remember that the people affected are the mothers and fathers  aunts and uncles  and grandmas and grandads of british children such as mine  they are our friends and our neighbours  valued members of local communities  doctors and nurses who look after us when we are ill  teachers who educate our children  and people who run companies employing thousands of british workers  to throw any doubt over their right to remain here in the future is to undermine family life  the stability of our public services  our economy and our society but  sadly  that is what the home secretary has done  instead of showing leadership and sending out an immediate message of reassurance in the aftermath of brexit  she has added to the uncertainty that many people were already experiencing  and she has left them feeling like bargaining chips in the brussels negotiations 
i could not agree more with the chair of the home affairs committee  people have been left feeling uncertain  as i will say later  that has created a hostile climate on the streets of our communities  and this is not what people are looking for in someone who seeks to lead our nation  it will not be lost on people that  for the second time in three days  the home secretary has failed to come to the house to clear up the confusion  i think we were entitled to hear directly from her  having called this important debate 
i will come on to that point  however  i do not see why  in seeking to secure the position of british nationals overseas  we should undermine people living here  paying taxes here  and working here 
my hon  friend makes a very important point  i have read in the guardian the views of some health professionals talking about how they feel  an allied healthcare professional   not a dj   who is dutch said this “since the referendum  i wish i had not come to the uk  half the population does not want me here  i am tearful at times  if i had the chance i would leave now ”it is not true  half the population does not want these people to leave  but that is obviously how they have been left to feel 
i hope the right hon  gentleman is correct  i do not know what the government’s intention is  but if we were to follow the logic of what we heard from the immigration minister at the dispatch box on monday  they will oppose the motion  we will see  tonight this house can remove the uncertainty from the people my hon  friend the member for walthamstow  stella creasy  described  sending them a message that they are welcome here in our country  and that is precisely what we should do 
it is an abdication of leadership for the home secretary not to be here to hear what my hon  friend has said  one can only speculate that she made those comments in a bid to woo the grassroots of the tory party in her current situation  i do not know  because she is not here to contradict me  she could have done if she wanted to  but she is not here to do so  i do not know whether her comments were made with that in mind  but i do know that they have caused a lot of worry for people  as my hon  friend says  they are in danger of making us look to the rest of the world like a very different country from the one that welcomed the world to london 2012 just four short years ago  a very different britain from the decent  open minded  fair country that we are perceived to be  or have been perceived to be  around the world 
i find it terrible that that is how people in britain in 2016 are thinking and feeling today as we have this debate  we should do something today to give my hon  friend’s constituent some comfort and to send the message that she is indeed valued here 
i am pleased to hear it  let us not rerun the arguments of the referendum campaign today  despite the fact that it has given rise to the situation that we are now in  to be fair to the hon  gentleman  he and others did not argue that people should be sent back   the leave campaign held the very clear position during the referendum that there should be no question of eu nationals having to return my worry is this  why have the government   the hon  gentleman’s front benchers   muddied the waters in the aftermath of the referendum  why are they not providing a basic reassurance to millions of people living here  i say that because it was entirely predictable that this question would arise following a potential brexit vote  the answer on why they cannot give a straight answer can be found in last week’s civil service world  which said “downing street on monday reiterated that the civil service had not done separate contingency work for the wider process of withdrawal   something the new team will now lead on ”i have a simple question for the minister  why on earth did the government not do any contingency planning so that they were in a position to give a straight answer to the people who are now worried about their status  yesterday  the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster  who is leading this work  told the foreign affairs committee that the unit set up to deal with brexit is still only looking at “options” for the next prime minister to consider  that is not good enough  may i remind conservative members that there is still a country to be run here  this will only add to the feeling that they have abdicated their responsibility to lead the country following the referendum and have plunged us into chaos 
my hon  friend puts her point very well if it were only labour members saying this  the public might think it is partisan or point scoring   but it is not  is it  we have just heard from somebody as senior as the hon  member for uxbridge and south ruislip  boris johnson   yesterday  the hon  member for reigate  crispin blunt  said that the failure to carry out any contingency planning in the event of brexit amounted to “gross negligence” and a “dereliction of duty” on the part of the prime minister  he went on to say that there was not a majority in the conservative party in support of the home secretary’s current position  we saw that for ourselves during the urgent question earlier this week  if there was ever a day for parliament to do the right thing  surely it is today  i hope that members opposite put their conscience and their constituents first and do the right thing 
in the absence of the home secretary  somebody needs to provide some leadership  don’t they  somebody needs to meet the community groups that are worried about the current situation  i hope that the minister is listening to what my hon  friend has just said  because the sheer lack of any direction at the moment is causing real difficulties on the streets of her constituency  mine and others 
that is precisely my position  those people came here when they were legally entitled to do so and are contributing to our society  absolutely  they should be allowed to stay  i am amazed that that is not the hon  gentleman’s position as well the clearest explanation of the government’s position came from the minister for immigration on monday “it has been suggested that the government could now fully guarantee eu nationals…the right to stay  but that would be unwise without a parallel assurance from european governments regarding british nationals living in their countries”      official report  4 july 2016  vol  612  c  607  i want to take the house through the logic of that position and what it means in practice  effectively  the government are saying that if  in the course of negotiations  britain was unable to secure the rights of british nationals living abroad  it would consider sending home eu nationals in retaliation  let me put it another way  the government are willing to put the lives of millions of people living here in limbo  and also the lives of their dependants  to secure the position of people who have chosen to make their life elsewhere  how can that be right  i have to say to the government that this is not good enough yesterday  we had an expansion on the government’s position from a spokesperson  who said this “at last night’s meeting of the 1922 committee theresa was very clear about the position of eu nationals in britain  and argued that it was equally important to consider the rights of british nationals living abroad” i am all in favour of the uk government doing all they can to secure the rights of uk nationals living in the rest of europe  but it should not be at the expense of the security of families who are living  working and paying taxes here  the effect of this position is to prioritise british nationals living abroad at the expense of those living here  and i cannot defend that  i would argue that the best way for our government to strengthen the position of british nationals living abroad is to make a decisive unilateral move now to secure the rights of  those from other countries who are living here  surely that would build the trust and good will that have been sorely lacking in the aftermath of the brexit vote there is no reason at all why this issue needs to get mixed up in the negotiations with europe  it was this government’s decision to make these 3 million people an issue in the negotiations  and it is entirely within the gift of the uk government to remove this uncertainty today and commit to changing the immigration rules  although i understand the minister’s argument that giving status to anyone who is already here before the uk formally leaves the uk could be an incentive for others to come here  he could easily fix that by making it clear that those with the right to stay have to have been resident in this country before 23 june  referendum day  it is very simple  a national insurance number would prove it  according to international convention  people should not have their rights retrospectively eroded  does it not follow that people who have made a life here  which was perfectly legal for them to do  should not have the rug pulled from underneath them there is another more serious implication of the failure to take away the uncertainty  it will create the conditions for the climate of hostility that we have seen since the referendum to continue  and with it the potential for abuse and violence  that is not something that any home secretary or home office minister should put his or her name to  if the government’s formal position is that they might in due course ask people to go home  it can only give encouragement to those who wish to stir up division and hatred in our communities 
i could not agree with the hon  lady more  that is exactly how these people feel  there have been quotes in the papers from people saying that that is the feeling they have been left with  many of those who work in our nhs  our schools and our universities can go and work elsewhere  and some of them are highly sought after individuals  if we do not send a clear message to them  others will 
that would be something  if the minister got up today and said that  perhaps these people would feel a little more valued than they do  we will have to wait to see whether anything is forthcoming  it is right for the hon  gentleman to say that putting obstacles in people’s way and making them pay fees just increases their sense of alienation from our country  i do not believe that any labour or scottish national party member wants to see that  neither  i suspect  do conservative members i was talking about the climate  there continue to be attacks  and the metropolitan police have received three reports an hour of abuse since the referendum   a rise of more than 50   yesterday in torquay  graffiti that read “eu rats go home now” was sprayed on a health centre  this is not on  the government could do something about this  if this climate carries on  it could have serious implications for the nhs and other public services  people who voted leave   i say this while looking at the hon  member for uxbridge and south ruislip   did not vote for this  they did not vote for their country to become a less welcoming  more hostile place  but in the absence of action and leadership from the government  that is exactly what is beginning to happen  only they can change it  and they need to do so now 
i will give way a couple more times before i finish  and of course i will give way to the chairman of the home affairs committee 
of course  it is impossible to deny the simple power of what my right hon  friend has just said  the generous  open minded gesture of saying now that people are welcome here would not just improve our position in negotiations and strengthen the position of british nationals living abroad  it would say something very important about our country and how it has not changed after the referendum  that is why the government should do it i want to end on a personal note  my wife  marie france  is a dutch national  and she has been here for 26 years since we met at university  in that time  she has been a volunteer working with young people who have learning disabilities  she has been involved in our children’s schools  she has run a business and employed people  following the death of her sister claire a decade ago  she has raised thousands and thousands of pounds through race for life for cancer research uk  i will be honest  she cried and cried after the brexit result was announced  although she has paid tax here for more than 20 years  she was not able to cast a vote in that momentous decision  she has never been able to vote for me in a general election  although she often threatens  that she would not vote for me if she could  as a result of brexit  she and other eu nationals could even lose their right to vote in local elections   that is no longer guaranteed unless there is a change in the law  the old saying “no taxation without representation” does not currently apply to the 3 million eu nationals living among us  we could say that this country is already treating them as second class citizens  they will be even worse off if we do not rectify the situation we are discussing today 
it was entirely wrong  as i said  what happened to no taxation without representation  i cannot defend a situation in which british nationals had the vote in the referendum even if they were living abroad but people living and paying taxes here did not  there was a basic unfairness in that  which needs to be corrected we have got this the wrong way around  and i sincerely hope that the government will act soon to confirm the legal right of eu nationals to be here  rather than dragging it out grudgingly  should we not take this opportunity to do the opposite and show them how much we value them by giving them that right to have their say at elections  we could go further  as the institute for public policy research has suggested and the hon  member for edinburgh east  tommy sheppard  said a moment ago  and offer british citizenship for free to any eu national working in our national health service or other public services 
i could not agree more  as i have been outlining  the thrust of government policy is already to treat them as second class citizens  because they do not have the same voting rights as other citizens  if they are now to be left in the lurch for two or three years  how will they feel at the end of that process  what will they think of our country  what will the countries that they come from think of us  i do not think any of us   certainly on the opposition benches   want that to happen those are big questions and are perhaps for another day  today  we have a very simple decision to make  we have an opportunity to do the right thing  take away our constituents’ worries and improve the climate on the streets of our communities  it is no secret that i have a high regard for the home secretary  even going so far as to give her a backhanded endorsement via twitter at  the weekend  i have seen her show leadership on difficult issues in the past  and i urge her to do so again tonight  real leadership would be giving her mps the chance to vote to take the uncertainty away and return a degree of stability to an uncertain and worried country  by passing the simple motion before us  we can send a simple message to those who have chosen to make their life here  we value you  and you are welcome here 
my hon  friend has raised a crucial point  i have read out some comments from health professionals that have been reported in the guardian  i have another here  from a german gp “i have lived and worked here for 16 years  it feels as if 50  of the population in the uk doesn’t want me here any more  i feel as if a rug has been pulled out from under my feet ”if people feel that they have no choice but to leave because they do not feel welcome  what will happen to our health service or to the time that people wait for a gp appointment  what would happen to the pressure on a e  and to hospital waiting lists  our nhs is utterly dependent on eu nationals who come to work here  and if they choose to leave  the nhs would be put at severe risk  that is why we should act  it is right for our public services and for those individuals and their families  but it is also right for us as a country to take this action tonight  so that we send a message from this parliament to europe and the rest of the world yes  people have expressed frustrations with the eu  but our country and its people have not changed  we are still that same place that has been renowned the world over for doing the fair  right and decent thing  amid all the chaos in our politics  let us take a step back today towards sanity and stability  and pass this motion overwhelmingly 
i am struggling to follow the logic of the minister’s position  he made a very angry statement a minute ago saying that they were not pawns  but he is saying explicitly that there is a negotiation here and that the government will not make commitments to them until they have got commitments over there  that is precisely what they are  why is he linking the two issues  why does he not just say to people living here  working here and paying taxes here that they are welcome to stay  and deal with the british nationals issue another day 
surely 23 june was the moment when the position changed  surely anyone who came here before that date came here in different circumstances  it is easy to trace everything to that day may i return the minister to the issue of the link with british nationals  the government have a responsibility to people who are living here today  are worried about their future  and are feeling insecure  why is the minister saying that people who have chosen  voluntarily  to make a life in another country are as important  if not more important  to the government than those who are already here in our communities 
i am grateful to the right hon  gentleman for giving way once again  he has been incredibly generous  i just want to clear one thing up before he concludes his remarks  how do the government propose to vote on the motion  one might have the impression  having listened to him  that they are getting ready to vote against it  but it has been suggested that they might abstain  let us be clear that if the government abstain  the motion will be carried and the message will go out from this house tonight that people are welcome here and that they will be able to stay 
i am grateful to the hon  gentleman for giving way  i just wanted to see whether his understanding is the same as mine  i think that we had an indication at the end of the minister’s speech that the government are planning to abstain on this motion tonight  it is a motion that gives eu nationals a right to remain   that is what it talks of  does he agree that  if they abstain and there are enough people on the opposition benches to carry the motion  that will be the position of the house of commons  there will be a resolution that people can stay and  in the future  the government will not be able to take that away 
i would customarily start a speech such as this by saying something like  “where is the home secretary ” but even i will admit that the right hon  member for maidenhead  mrs may  has better things to do today  i want to take this opportunity on behalf of the opposition benches to pay tribute to her tenure as home secretary  i have found that she has certainly been prepared to listen  particularly in the case of hillsborough  on which her work was outstanding for the families who had faced a terrible injustice for all those years  i hope that she will continue to listen  and i have every hope that she will go on to make a good prime minister i also pay tribute to the right hon  member for south holland and the deepings  mr hayes   the minister of state   for now  with the fast impending reshuffle  he will be twitchy on the front bench  but i suspect that his obvious talents will be rightly rewarded the order before the house today arises from the terrorism act 2000  which was passed by the previous labour government and was intended to provide a flexible framework to deal with the changing and emerging threat of new forms of terrorism  it is fair to say that we have seen unimaginable events in the 16 years since that legislation was originally enacted  specifically  we have seen the rise of terrorism based on a distortion of islam and its values  it is important to describe it as such rather than use the shorthand “islamic terrorism”  because that is inaccurate and makes life harder for those in the muslim community who face a daily and monumental battle against this perversion of their faith  let us be careful in our language and help those battling radicalisation  not those who foment it the bbc has taken to using the phrase “so called islamic state”  in my view  that is not helpful  the use of “so called” does not undermine “islamic” or “state” and those are the two words that the public hear  it gives undeserved status to the organisation and makes it sound as though it is an authorised branch of islam  i urge the director general of the bbc to review that editorial decision and to move  as the government have  to the use of daesh  that is important  as i said at the beginning  because we face a highly changeable and challenging terrorism landscape figures from the “global peace index 2016” report show that deaths from terrorism increased by 80  in the past year  only 69 countries did not record a terrorist incident  the intensity of terrorist activity is also increasing  last year  11 countries reported 500 or more deaths from terrorist incidents   double the year before   and incidents are happening all the time  last month  a police officer was killed in france  for which daesh claimed responsibility  and 44 people were killed and 239 injured by a bomb at istanbul airport  for which it is suspected that daesh was again responsible  those are big increases on a rising trend  the year 2014 saw some 13 500 terrorist attacks around the world and 32 700 deaths  this is the context in which we are considering today’s order  as the terrorism landscape changes  the government are right to be vigilant and to try to keep one step ahead we are being asked today to give agreement to the government to proscribe four organisations linked to terrorism  two have links to al qaeda and the others  have links with daesh  the public and political debate is obviously focused on the activities of daesh in syria and the wider middle east  it would however be a mistake for this house to lose sight of what is happening in asia  particularly south east asia  as the minister rightly said  it would be a further mistake for the house to focus on daesh and to lose focus on al qaeda and its efforts to regroup  that is why the government are right to bring this order for consideration today and to disrupt the activities of the relevant organisations before they establish a stronger foothold  the evidence that the home office put before the house makes it clear that there are grounds to proscribe the organisations we accept that evidence and will support the order this afternoon  but i want to make one point before i close that i ask the minister and the government to take into account  i want to go back to when the legislation was first introduced and to the first group of organisations to be proscribed under the 2000 act  which included the international sikh youth federation  there were objections at the time and what followed was a protracted legal argument in the courts  which ended only recently  and led to the government coming to the house to lift the proscription  learning from that experience  i say to the minister that evidence does change over time  there may have been grounds to proscribe that organisation back then  but those grounds clearly expired some time ago  however  the people to which such orders relate may find that they stigmatise a section of their community 
i strongly agree with the chair of the home affairs committee  the experience of the sikh community in challenging the proscription of the international sikh youth federation was pretty dispiriting  in that it had to pursue a lengthy legal process while facing an unresponsive home office  there may be good grounds to proscribe organisations   my right hon  friend the member for leicester east  keith vaz  accepted that there was a case with the organisation that he mentioned   but the stigma does affect a much wider community when the evidence changes  so should the government  who should act quickly to remove any perceptions  i hope that they listen to what my right hon  friend said   and they would be right to  because he is full of judgment and wisdom on such matters  my only request of the government is that they institute a regime of the kind that he suggests  that there is a regular process of review  and that there are up to date assessments of the organisations that pose a genuine threat to the safety  of our country  we should also make the challenge process easier than it was found to be by members of the sikh community that is the only caveat that i place on our support for the order  terrorism is a threat to our country  it is right that we take every possible action to root it out and we should work with the communities that struggle to deal with it  the government are right to bring the order before the house today and we will give it our full support 
rose   
before the minister sits down  will he address the point that i raised  and that was echoed by the hon  member for dumfries and galloway  richard arkless   i am talking about the use by the bbc of the phrase  “so called islamic state”  i have been in mosques recently and seen how it causes great despondency among the people who are trying to counter radicalisation  they say that the use of the words “so called” does not undermine the words “islamic” or “state”  they feel very strongly that  by repeating that phrase  the bbc is only making their job harder  will the minister join the scottish national party  the labour party and  hopefully  the conservative party in sending a clear message to the bbc today that it needs to review this editorial decision 
i start by welcoming the home secretary to her new position and welcoming her well judged and heartfelt words to the house today  she spoke for us all in condemning this nauseating attack  and in sending our sympathy and solidarity to the families affected and to the french people  from the very outset of the right hon  lady’s tenure  let me assure her of my ongoing support in presenting a united front from this house to those who plan and perpetrate these brutal acts it is a sad reflection of the dark times in which we live that this is the third time in the last nine months that we have gathered to discuss a major terrorist incident in mainland europe  each new incident brings new factors and changes perceptions of the nature of the threat posed by modern terrorism   and this one was no different  this was an act of indiscriminate and sickening brutality  made all the more abhorrent by the targeting of families and children  ten children and babies were killed  50 are still being treated  and many more have been orphaned and left with lasting psychological scars  unlike other attacks  this was not planned by a cell with sophisticated tactics and weapons  a similar attack could be launched anywhere at any time  and that is what makes it so frightening and so difficult to predict and prevent let me start with the question of whether there are any immediate implications for the united kingdom  on friday  a spokeswoman for the prime minister said that uk police were “reviewing” security plans for “large public events” taking place this week  what conclusions were reached as part of that review  and were any changes made in the light of it  will the home secretary be issuing any updated security advice to the organisers of the numerous large public gatherings and festivals that will take place throughout the country over the rest of the summer  we welcome the mayor of london’s confirmation that the metropolitan police were reviewing safety measures in the capital  can the home secretary confirm that similar reviews are taking place in large cities throughout the united kingdom after the attacks in paris  the home secretary’s predecessor committed herself to an urgent review of our response to firearms attacks  it has been suggested in the french media that if armed officers had been on the scene more quickly in nice  they could have prevented the lorry from travelling as far as it did  has the review that was commissioned been completed  and if so  what changes in firearms capability are proposed as a result  in the wake of paris  the home secretary’s predecessor also promised to protect police budgets  but that has  not been honoured  and there are real terms cuts this year  will the new home secretary pledge today to protect police budgets in real terms the home secretary mentioned the prevent programme  i have to say that i do not share her complacent view of what it is achieving  in fact  some would say that it is counter productive  creating a climate of suspicion and mistrust and  far from tackling extremism  creating the very conditions for it to flourish  the government’s own independent reviewer of terrorism legislation has said that the whole programme“could benefit from independent review ”will the home secretary accept labour’s call for a cross party review of how the statutory prevent duty is working immediately after the attack  it was described in the media as an act of islamic terrorism  but it is now clear that the lifestyle of the individual had absolutely nothing to do with the islamic faith  and the french authorities have cast doubt on whether there was any link between him and daesh  does the home secretary agree that promptly labelling this attack islamic terrorism hands a propaganda coup to the terrorists  whose whole purpose is to deepen the rift between the muslim community and the rest of society  does she agree that more care should be taken with how such atrocities are labelled in future this was  of course  the first attack in europe since the european union referendum  can the home secretary assure the house that  in these times  she and the wider government are making every effort to maintain strong collaboration with the french and the european authorities  and to send them the clear message that  whatever our differences  britain will always be by their side and ready to help 
 urgent question   to ask the home secretary if she will clarify comments made last week in another place on calls for a public inquiry into policing at the orgreave coking plant in 1984 
i promised the hillsborough families the full truth about the 20 year cover up  they will not have it until we also know what happened after orgreave  a year ago the ipcc found senior officers gave untrue statements exaggerating violence from miners to distract from their own use of force  some would say brutality  so the force that would wrongly blame liverpool supporters tried to do the same against the miners five years before  in response  the then home secretary promised to consider a public inquiry  that was welcome because the miners’ strike caused deep scars when  in the words of a former chief constable  the police were used as an “army of occupation”  the orgreave truth and justice campaign has  as the home secretary said  submitted an application  but there was a somewhat unexpected announcement in another place last week that it would now be substantially delayed  the advocate general’s exact words were “the ipcc told home office officials that if it announced any action to set up an inquiry or other investigation relating to orgreave  it would have an impact on the hillsborough investigation ”     official report  house of lords  13 july 2016  vol  744  c  216  however  the deputy chair of the ipcc says “i would like to clarify that the ipcc has not taken or offered any position on whether there should be a public inquiry   that is a decision that is entirely a matter for the home secretary ”that is why we have brought the home secretary here today i welcome the home secretary’s offer to meet me  but might it not help to build the right climate if she today corrects the misleading impression given to parliament that the ipcc had advised against the establishment of an inquiry at this time  does she accept that there is no reason why ongoing investigations should delay an orgreave inquiry  and that in similar situations it is commonplace for protections to be put in place to manage any risks  can she see why the government’s actions look like a home office manoeuvre to shunt a controversial issue into the long grass this  one of the final decisions of the former home secretary  was announced as she stood on the steps of downing street promising to “fight injustice”  people may remember another tory prime minister quoting st francis of assisi outside no  10 and the subsequent gap that emerged between her fine words and her deeds  to ensure that history does not repeat itself  will the home secretary do the right thing  will she restore the trust that has been damaged among people who have already waited more than 30 years for the truth and  today order a full public inquiry into orgreave 
a decade ago  labour introduced a points based system for non eu migration  in the referendum campaign  five of the home secretary’s cabinet colleagues and many conservative mps pledged to extend it  as my hon  friend the member for wallasey  ms eagle  has said  without consultation or debate  the prime minister today ruled that out but failed to tell us what she would do instead  that comes as the italian government make this warning  the more the uk government limit eu citizens in the uk  the more the italian government will limit the presence of uk goods in europe  the stakes are high  but just when the country needs leadership  we have confusion  the home secretary presented proposals to the cabinet last week  will the minister tell us what they were so that we can begin finally to have a proper debate about what brexit means for britain 
that was a complete non answer  people at home might wonder why we are getting non answers on brexit  it is because the government told the civil service not to plan for it  hence the confusion we are in  there is one issue that the minister could clear up today   the status of eu nationals who are already here  the failure to address that is creating uncertainty for families who have chosen to make their lives here  and hostility towards some eu nationals  the whole country was appalled by the attack in harlow in late august that led to the death of a polish national  arkadiusz jozwik  it is in the minister’s and the home secretary’s gift to change that climate  will he and she respect the unanimous vote of this house back in july and confirm the status of all eu nationals who are already here 
i  too  welcome the home secretary to her first questions  but i do hope we will get better answers than the ones we have just had from the immigration minister  i will give it one more go  mr speaker  this time on security last week  in relation to discussions with the french government on calais  a senior government source briefed the times that the uk might withdraw co operation on counter terrorism if it does not get its way  referencing the nice attack  at a time when france is facing an unprecedented terror threat  that is utterly crass  it is also counter productive  as the terror networks that threaten france could have links here  will the home secretary today distance herself from this insensitive threat  vow that there will be no repeat of it  and commit to maintaining the fullest co operation with our eu counterparts and neighbours on counter terrorism  including to maintaining our involvement in the european arrest warrant
