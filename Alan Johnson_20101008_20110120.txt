will the timing of the spending cuts that are to be announced next week be exactly as laid out in june s emergency budget  and will the chancellor confirm that the aim continues to be that the deficit will be eliminated by 2015 
well  the reason i ask is that there was some speculation at the weekend  when the energy secretary suggested  in a rather unfortunate yachting analogy  that he would not be  lashed to the mast  with a particular set of spending numbers  that is important  because from my vast experience in this job i am absolutely clear about this  the chancellor says that the deficit was wrong and that his emergency budget measures were unavoidable  but i believe that it is the other way round  the deficit was unavoidable if we were to avoid financial meltdown  and his budget proposals were entirely wrong wrong because they would  according to the institute for fiscal studies  have two and a half times the adverse effect on the poorest as on the richest in our society  and wrong because he is seeking to cut public spending before there is any momentum for private sector spending in our economy 
mr speaker     interruption   
mr speaker  we remember well the cheers at the end of the emergency budget in june  when the chancellor finished on a peroration about his budget being progressive and fair  it took the institute for fiscal studies only 48 hours to show that it was totally unfair  and that the burden of the emergency budget fell two and half times more on the poorest than on the richest  we have seen today hon  members cheering the deepest cuts to public spending in living memory  for some government members  that is their ideological objective     interruption    not all of them  but for many  that is what they came into politics for     interruption   
today is the day that abstract figures and spreadsheets turn into people s futures  people s jobs  people s pensions  people s services and their prospects for the future  and the day when the statistics that were nestling comfortably in the lap of the chief secretary yesterday actually become the uncomfortable truth for many people and families throughout this country we hear the chant on every occasion  but government members are deficit deceivers  they have peddled a whole series of myths to the british public  the most incredible myth of all is that the biggest global economic crisis since the great depression is the fault of the previous government     interruption    you see  the strings are pulled and away they go the chancellor said that the government have brought britain back from the brink of bankruptcy  perhaps he will confirm three facts  fact no  1  when the global crisis hit  the uk had the second lowest debt of any g7 country  fact no  2  the previous government inherited a debt interest level of 10p in every £1 of tax received  and even after a world recession  we bequeathed a figure that was 15  lower  fact no  3  the interest rates that the uk pays on its debt have been falling since the beginning of the year  perhaps the chancellor  in the interests of accuracy  can confirm those statistics when the last comprehensive spending review took place in 2007  the chancellor was the shadow chancellor  was he calling for reduced public spending  read the  hansard  was he calling for regulation of the banking industry  i have two things to say about 2007  i have read his contribution to the debate  first  instead of arguing for reduced public spending  he argued that we were spending too little  he complained that we were slowing the growth in health and education expenditure  indeed  the conservative party supported every penny of our spending plans until well after the collapse of lehman brothers in america  which set off the disastrous chain reaction that caused the global recession in 2007  far from calling for regulation of the banks  the conservatives were calling for deregulation of the banks  the right hon  member for wokingham  mr redwood  produced a report on behalf of the then leader of the opposition who had called for greater regulation of the banking industry  we need to get the facts right the chancellor described his emergency budget in june as being unavoidable and fair  we know that it was unfair  because the ifs produced the statistics with devastating and forensic accuracy a few hours later  and we also know that it was avoidable  the deficit has to be paid down   hon  members   ah    here they go again  the chief whip s spreadsheet tells them when to stand up and what to say  where is he  he does not need to move to have influence on his back benchers  so we do need to bring the deficit down today s reckless gamble with people s livelihoods runs the risk of stifling the fragile recovery  the ridiculous analogy with credit card debts insults the intelligence of the british public  if countries around the world had not run up debts that is what the fiscal deficit is  by the way to sustain their economies  people would have lost not their credit cards  but lost their jobs  lost their houses and lost their savings  the liberal democrats know that  and they argued that when seeking the support of the electorate  the deputy prime minister argued that  and then he discovered greece  in the period between the ballot box closing and his ministerial car door opening  the deputy prime minister discovered a different approach like us  the liberal democrats every single one of them were elected to this house on a platform that said  in the context of reducing the deficit  that speed kills  the chancellor repeats a long list of those who support his swift cuts  he mentions it all the time  curiously  he failed to mention the other countries in the united kingdom scotland  wales and northern ireland which do not support these measures  perhaps that is why he calls himself a one nation tory  here is another supportive quotation that he missed out  and he can take this down and use it in future briefings  the measures we have taken have been commended by international bodies such as the european central bank  the european commission  the imf and the oecd  they have also won the approval of the international markets  that was the irish minister of finance last december  when he told the irish parliament that his austerity plan meant that they had turned the corner  four months later  they slid back into recession the concerns of those watching this announcement today went beyond the misrepresentation of figures and the clever punch and judy stuff in which we all engage including myself at times  they will be interested in whether they will stay in work  whether they will stay in their homes and whether they will stay safe on the streets  we are told that the expected job losses from this spending review and the chancellor confirmed it will be some 490 000  pricewaterhousecoopers reported last week that 1 million jobs were at stake because the impact on the private sector is just as severe  is it not the case that at the same time as the government are throwing people out of work  they are reducing the support to help people return to the workplace i applaud the ideas and the efforts of the secretary of state for work and pensions to do what we were seeking to do and make work pay     interruption    he often gives credit to what we did when we were in government  the fact is  however  that today s proposals will make it harder for people to return to work because of the changes to working tax credit  because of the changes to support for working parents  and because of the huge increase in fares for those who have to travel to get the jobs  the secretary of state has had his job made harder by today s announcement on housing  the chancellor has announced the retreat of central government from any role in building new affordable homes  can he tell the house how many jobs will be lost in the construction sector as a result of his decision to all but end capital funding for house building  crime has fallen dramatically in the last 13 years  i heard what the chancellor said about the report from her majesty s inspectorate of constabulary  but the home office is not a protected department  as it deals with counter terrorism and policing  the public will be worried that they will lose more police on the streets spending has to be reduced     interruption    yes  spending has to be reduced  but the front line services on which people rely must be protected  we support moves to ring fence the health budget   hon  members   ah    the point about the health service is not that its budgets will be protected  it is the taking of £2 billion to £3 billion out of those budgets to pay for a top down structural reorganisation that the conservatives told the public in their manifesto would not happen  this is the top down reorganisation to end all top down reorganisations  and we are already seeing the loss of jobs in the nhs as a result on education  the chancellor mentioned that the pupil premium would be funded  there are stories already about teachers and teaching assistants losing their jobs as a result of today s announcement  we will have to look at the statistics carefully  including the small print  before we can see what is happening on education  the chancellor said that they will keep a version of education maintenance allowance  that is good  because it has been the biggest single contributor to lifting the number of children from poorer homes who stay in education and it was introduced by the labour government  he told us that it will be introduced in some form  but he did not say how  nor did he say what effect the removal of ring fences will have on sure start  which is crucially important to ensuring that we have a more progressive society on the nhs  we believe that the real terms increase will be more than swallowed by the cost of the reorganisation  it would be good if the chancellor could confirm that the baseline for the nhs will exactly reflect its actual budget this year  it seems to us from the statistics that there may be some smoke and mirrors without growth  the job of getting the deficit down becomes impossible  a rising dole queue means a bigger welfare bill and less tax coming in a cost of at least half a billion pounds for every 100 000 people thrown out of work by the government s approach  to get the deficit down  the starting point must be jobs  jobs  jobs  that remains the core of the difference between us and the government  we were told that the ministry of justice will see 14 000 jobs cut  does the chancellor agree with the department s assessment that the vast majority of those 11 000 will be from the front line  can he confirm that £230 million of taxpayers  funds have been earmarked for redundancy costs in that department alone  what is the total scale of redundancies expected across the public sector  what will the total redundancy bill be  thanks to the chief secretary s gaffe yesterday  we know that the treasury has provided the chancellor with estimates  he should share them with the house  can the chancellor confirm that the poorest will still bear a greater burden than the richest  with the middle squeezed even further  and that women will shoulder three quarters of the cuts  does he still claim that these measures are progressive and fair there is an alternative approach  the chancellor finished by suggesting that their cuts were the same as ours   hon  members   less    less than ours  that is even more utter and complete nonsense  for two reasons  first  the conservatives calculated the 20  figure by some very dodgy formulae that stretched the limit of credibility for the protected departments  secondly  the chancellor has not caught up with the fact that we have listed a series of measures with which we agree for instance  the increase in capital gains tax and the changes to welfare  the chancellor has not caught up with the statements that we have made about the welfare bill  we will look at the further measures that the chancellor has announced today  but if we take the statements that we have made into account  we came into this debate with departmental cuts half the level of those that the government are proposing this spending review is not about economic necessity  it is about political choices  the chancellor argues that labour would have done nothing about the deficit  he goes on to say that his cuts are no worse than ours  he cannot have it both ways  he cannot be right in both arguments  although he does manage to be wrong on both counts  the difference between us is that the government are removing almost twice as much from department budgets  while we were looking for a much more gradual  much slower reduction  which would not stifle the very low levels of growth in our economy  it is our firm belief that the rush to cut the deficit endangers the recovery and reduces the prospects for employment in the short term and for prosperity in the longer term  we believe that we can and should sustain a more gradual reduction  securing growth  i do not believe that the chancellor or the prime minister sufficiently understands the worries and concerns of families up and down this country  those worries will have multiplied considerably as a result of the chancellor s statement today 
i add the congratulations of this side of the house to prince william and catherine middleton on their engagement  if they need a photographer  i understand that there is one available now  there has been a nice juxtaposition of announcements this morning  does the chancellor think that he is aiding tax simplification by raising vat to a nice round 20   and does he agree with his cabinet colleague  the business secretary  who once described an increase in vat as a tax on the poor to absolve the sins of the rich    
that was not the question  the fact that one looks at every available tax before reaching a conclusion is nothing new  the conclusion we reached is that vat should not be increased and that national insurance should be  the liberal democrats have been very fair in the way that they have betrayed the electorate  they have broken promises across the age divide children  students and pensioners so there is no age discrimination there  the conservatives specifically said that they would not increase vat  during the election campaign  we said that if they did not increase national insurance  they would increase vat  the prime minister denied that and said that they had no plans to increase vat  he said that vat was very regressive  it hits the poorest the hardest  i can promise members that it does  we are now in the unique situation in which we face a tax rise that our prime minister has promised will affect  the poorest the hardest   at the time  the conservatives said that an increase in national insurance would be  a tax on jobs   the chartered institute of personnel and development said that it would lead to 75 000 jobs being lost while an increase in vat would cost 250 000 jobs 
why is the chancellor proceeding with this tax on jobs that hits the poorest the hardest 
i thank the chancellor for advance notice of his statement and for keeping me informed about developments over the weekend the opposition agree with the chancellor s basic argument that ireland is a friend in need and that britain should not simply ignore the plight of one of our biggest trading partners because it is in the eurozone and we are not  so we are in principle content to support a role for the uk in assisting ireland to secure economic stability the chancellor talked about the resilience of our banks  and the question that many people will be asking today is why he thought it was wrong for the previous government to support british banks but right for his government to support ireland s banks  on the crucial question of ensuring that britain s contribution is fair and balanced  will he first explain how our relative share of the burden will be calculated and what his definition of  fair  will be secondly  will he give his expectation of the proportion of uk support that will go through each european route the european financial stability facility  the stabilisation mechanism and the bilateral arrangements and the rationale for that distribution  he said that he disagreed with the agreement that my right hon  friend the member for edinburgh south west  mr darling  made in may to enter the european stabilisation mechanism  yet the chancellor is seeking to provide bilateral support  why does he need to provide bilateral support when the other routes are available  will he also tell the house how  when and where each element will appear in government accounts thirdly  what interest rate is to be charged on our loans  what form will it take and when does he expect to receive full repayment  i understand the issues he mentioned about not being able to tell us now  but if he cannot give us any indication  when and how will that information be reported to the house fourthly  what conditions will the chancellor seek to apply  and is he preparing this proposal unilaterally or in conjunction with our european partners  will there be any attempt to interfere with ireland s right to set its own tax rates  will the chancellor tell us to what degree he believes the difficulties are a consequence of ireland s adoption of the euro  what does he think this will mean for the future of the single currency  when his right hon  friend the foreign secretary was asked if he thought the euro would survive  he shrugged his shoulders and said   who knows   that strikes me as being at the least undiplomatic and at most unworthy of the great office he holds  it could even be said to be making  i told you so  into an economic policy  how would the chancellor answer the question about whether the euro will survive finally  it is clear that ireland s efforts to cut its deficit so deeply and quickly have failed to lead to growth in the economy  the private sector has not taken up the slack caused by the huge cuts to public services  so will the chancellor agree that growth is crucial to ireland  europe and  indeed  to the uk s full recovery and tell us what steps he is taking to encourage growth as part of this package  in 2006  he said that we should  look and learn from across the irish sea   in a eulogy to the deregulation of the financial services sector  he asked  what has caused this irish miracle  and how can we in britain emulate it  now he needs to assure us that he has learned other lessons from across the irish sea  the last time he made a statement from that dispatch box  he said that britain was on  the brink of bankruptcy   but that was clearly not the case  now he is proposing to make a substantial contribution to a country that really is on the brink  one lesson from ireland should be salutary  exaggerated rhetoric affects confidence and loss of confidence can lead to economic disaster 
let us move from bombast to reality  here is what the obr says  as we discussed in chapters 3 and 4  past experience and common sense suggest that our central forecasts for both the economy and the public finances are almost certain to be wrong and that there are upside and downside risks to both  the only question is on which side of wrong they actually fall this government have committed our country to a rate of fiscal consolidation that has been attempted only twice in living memory  and on both occasions by countries that benefited from strong growth in a benign global environment  in the current economic crisis  no country other than ireland has attempted to cut so deeply  so quickly  the chancellor is always telling us that we have the highest fiscal deficit in the g20  that is not true  the us has a proportionally higher fiscal deficit than ours  and the americans plan to reduce it by less than half over the next five years  japan  which has roughly the same level of deficit  has learnt from its experience over the past 10 years and plans to cut by less than a quarter  the chancellor has chosen to take an unprecedented gamble with people s livelihoods and the country s future  and he has done so on the basis of a fundamental deceit  that when he assumed office  the public finances were worse than expected  the obr exposed that deceit last year  and it has confirmed it today  so will the chancellor now tell all those back benchers behind him all those tories who claim to their constituents that things are worse than they expected  and of course those who tell them that they have never had it so good that they will have to find a new excuse  nothing in his statement today can hide the fact that it was the balanced approach of my right hon  friend the member for edinburgh south west  mr darling    hon  members    where is he    snowed in  in scotland  probably  it was the balanced approach of my right hon  friend that saw growth return at the beginning of the year  saw the recovery gain momentum and led to nearly 1 million fewer people claiming out of work benefits than predicted  that was the previous chancellor  not this one as expected  the obr has produced a higher growth forecast for this year than at the time of the emergency budget  but this is the result of an approach that this government have rejected  the reckless gamble that coalition members support is still to come  the chancellor is in the casino  but he has not yet spun the wheel  the obr s judgment of the future matters more than its revised forecast for a year that is almost over does the chancellor accept that the obr does not expect the fast momentum built up this year to be maintained  indeed  it is explicit in saying that it expects a slow recovery  next year  as spending cuts begin to take effect and the vat hike dampens demand  the obr is revising its growth forecast down from 2 6  before the emergency budget to 2 3  immediately afterwards and to 2 1  now it is going south  looking beyond next year  the forecast for growth over the first four years of the recovery is reduced to an average of 2 4   this compares with a 3 1  average growth in the far from pain free recoveries from the two tory recessions in the 1980s and 1990s  that growth was largely driven by growth in the financial sector and in public services  neither of which will be in a position to help this time lower growth means fewer jobs  and in this weak recovery the obr  having changed its mind  is now forecasting something that the chancellor could not bring himself to say namely  that unemployment will rise next year  it no wonder that the conservative led local government association pointed out last week that front loading cuts in local authorities will lead to 140 000 job losses next year  which is much higher than originally expected  the chartered institute of personnel and development estimates that the increase in vat on 4 january will cost 250 000 jobs  more than three times as many as our proposed increase in national insurance  which the conservatives called a tax on jobs the chancellor tells us that public sector jobs will be protected by his decision to cut welfare benefits  but this works both ways  can he tell the house what the additional hit to private sector jobs will be from those welfare changes  for families up and down this country  a jobless recovery will be no recovery at all  this government have no interest in protecting jobs  no alternative measures if the gamble fails and  worst of all  no plan for jobs  indeed  since just last week their growth plan has actually shrunk  from a white paper that was supposed to contain proposals  to today s promise to talk  there will now be a debate  a discussion the government s plans rely on a huge increase in exports and business investment  let us hope they materialise  but it is a gamble to assume that cuts on the scale envisaged  with cyclically adjusted public borrowing reduced by 8  of gross domestic product in just five years  will automatically be compensated for by exports  exports need markets  and there is nothing to suggest that the global economic climate will assist us in achieving the kind of boost to growth that we have not seen for 60 years the chancellor talked about his plans for corporation tax  everyone wants a tax system that supports business  but he has abolished investment allowances for manufacturing to pay for a cut in corporation tax that will give a further £1 billion to the banks  can he tell us what sense there is in helping companies that make large profits for little investment  at the expense of businesses that will invest heavily in the uk  we were very pleased to hear his announcement on glaxosmithkline and the patent box  we were pleased because that was our proposal  it was me  as secretary of state for health  with the former business minister  lord dyson  who argued for that in cabinet  that is why it was in last year s pre budget report  it is an excellent proposal  it was a labour proposal here is an idea for the star chamber that the government are going to form  why not help uk advanced manufacturing in the civil nuclear supply chain by giving an £80 million loan to sheffield forgemasters  that is an idea that they can chew over for the next four months the chancellor talked about developments relating to ireland  as i said last week  we support the financial assistance offered to ireland  but the lessons of ireland cannot be ignored  as a  financial times leader said last week  a slower pace of consolidation might have been its best bet at encouraging growth  that is a lesson for us as well the chancellor s analytical ability in respect of ireland was demonstrated in his 2006 article  which has been widely quoted  but in 2008  just two years ago  confident that ireland would not be affected by the financial crisis that was just emerging  he said that ireland now had a  future fund  of assets built to provide security against future shocks and liabilities  their public finances are well placed  their competitiveness has risen  their institutions are stronger  ireland had used the fat years to prepare for the lean years  the chancellor was wrong about ireland  and he is wrong about the united kingdom  the autumn statement does nothing to alleviate the summer madness that led him to gamble so recklessly with our future 
lord drayson 
get on with it  george 
we will support the bill  the more i listen to the chancellor  the more my admiration and respect grows for his predecessor  my right hon  friend the member for edinburgh south west  mr darling   on 8 may  my right hon  friend negotiated arrangements under which the uk remained outside the €440 billion european financial stability facility and ensured that we did not contribute as much as a rusty old drachma to the bail out of greece 
i will take interventions later in his statement on 22 november repeated today the chancellor said that he counselled his predecessor against joining the european financial stabilisation mechanism  which was a pre existing fund involving all 27 member states and was worth only a seventh of the larger facility  as the chancellor said  my right hon  friend the member for edinburgh south west is in his place and if he catches your eye  mr deputy speaker  he can give his recollection of that conversation however  given that the mechanism the smaller amount was decided by qualified majority voting  it seems that agreeing to ensure that we stay out of the €440 billion efsf was a good deal for our country  particularly as my right hon  friend ensured that none of the mechanism of which we were part was used to bail out greece  that was a good deal all round  and a lesson for our inexperienced chancellor in the art of negotiation  indeed  the quip going round a couple of years ago  when the collapse of the banking industry in iceland was closely followed by what happened in ireland  was  what is the difference between iceland and ireland  answer one letter and six months  a modern variation could be to ask  what is the difference between darling and osborne  answer five letters  six months and £6 6 billion 
i believe that the hon  gentleman will seek to address that in his amendment to clause 3  which we will discuss later  on the specific issue  there is no doubt that the mechanism was decided by qualified majority voting  all 27 european member states were part of that  i know from experience of negotiating in europe over many years that it is a pretty turgid process and one has to be on one s toes  my right hon  friend the member for edinburgh south west can speak for himself  but i think he got a very good deal for this country on greece the chancellor must take responsibility for the deal that he has negotiated and not try spuriously to blame his predecessor  as he did again in his evidence to the treasury select committee on 8 december  he had a choice about whether the uk should contribute to the irish rescue plan  in principle  he has made the right choice  but before us today is a hastily drawn up bill that does not set out the terms of the loan  the interest rate or the repayment schedule  colleagues from all parties will want to explore and probe those matters in committee  and we particularly want to get to our amendments on clause 2  so a goodly proportion of the time available to us this afternoon may be better spent on that  it is therefore not my intention to detain the house for long on second reading 
i always try to avoid sharing the hon  gentleman s pleasure  i shall come to the nature of the deal  because in debating the bill we are discussing one element that constitutes a little more than half of the money that the uk taxpayer is putting into the deal the argument for treating ireland as a special case is clear  i shall reiterate some of the points that the chancellor made  our two countries are intertwined in commerce  in trade  in banking  in culture and in sport  we share a language and a land border  not only is ireland one of our five largest export markets but  as the chancellor said  one part of the united kingdom northern ireland sends 40  of its exports across the border to the republic  the situation in ireland could cause significant damage to uk financial institutions and create instability in both sovereign and bank debt markets  the uk is ireland s largest creditor we are talking about almost €112 billion and i understand from a newspaper report last week that the royal bank of scotland and lloyds have irish loan books worth 82  and 53  of net assets respectively in its report last month  the international monetary fund singled out ireland to demonstrate what it called the  key underlying vulnerability  of uk banks  exposure to foreign banks  the support programme assures the protection of senior bond holders in irish banks from any losses  thus affording a greater level of protection to uk banks  for all of those reasons and many more  it is in this country s interest to support this package i want to raise three concerns  the first  which was raised in a couple of interventions including by the hon  member for stone  mr cash  is the open ended nature of the commitment  there is a distinct possibility of more money being required for ireland after 2013  given the tendency of irish banks to downplay the severity of their situation and the tough conditionality being applied alongside concerns about european growth  in those circumstances  should we not make it clear to our european partners that the efsf must be used for any further financial support  rather than giving the impression that this is a well into which further buckets can be dipped that is particularly relevant to my second concern about the balance between the contributions made by the various mechanisms  the €440 billion efsf the facility  for eurozone countries only is being tapped for 4  of the total resources that eurozone countries have agreed to make available for ireland  the smaller efsm the mechanism of which we are part and to which we contribute  was not used at all for the greek bail out  the efsm is offering 37 5  of its available resources for the irish bail out  why was that formulation chosen and why is the total amount we are contributing double the amount that we would have had to pay if we were a eurozone country 
i am grateful to the chancellor for that intervention  however  it does not explain why the £3 25 billion he has just mentioned is the bilateral loan  that is the equivalent of what we would have put into the irish bail out had we been members of the eurozone  however  we are also putting in £2 6 billion through the efsm and £800 million through the imf  with the bilateral loan added to the other donations of british taxpayers  contributions that we are making through the mechanisms  we are putting in double the amount of money that other european union countries are contributing 
this may be news to the hon  gentleman  but his party is in government now  as i said  my party ensured that we contributed nothing not a penny  not a euro  not a drachma to the greek bailout  the chancellor is coming before this house with a £6 6 billion contribution to ireland  which we support  but the various aspects of the mechanism need to be explained and understood 
we have the €60 billion fund  about which the hon  member for dover  charlie elphicke  intervened  and we have a second fund of €440 billion  i am simply pointing out the public deserve to know this that only 4  is coming from the larger amount and 37  from the smaller amount  i am curious about that  and we need to understand the logic of it 
maybe 
i do agree that part of it should be bilateral  for all the reasons that i have mentioned  as various members have commented  however  we need to understand why the formulation has been made because it could be setting precedents  because there is a larger pot of money out of which a lesser sum of money is being brought  and because the chancellor can come back to this house  by virtue of a statutory instrument and seek further money for ireland  we need to be clear what we are letting ourselves in for 
no  i will not give way perhaps later i am also curious about the following piece of distorted logic  in the treasury committee  the chancellor said that it was okay to set austerity aside in order to make a loan to ireland because of the promise of repayment  he said that this loan  adds to our debt  but we re getting back a very important asset which is a commitment from the irish government to pay us back with interest  what puzzles me is which part of that definition of a sensible loan did not apply to sheffield forgemasters    hon  members   oh    i am sorry that government  members groan about british manufacturing industry  my right hon  friend the member for sheffield  brightside and hillsborough  mr blunkett  raised this issue during the chancellor s statement on 22 november  why does the chancellor agree a huge loan to ireland on the basis he cited but reject a modest £80 million that would be paid back with interest and boost the opportunity of british manufacturers to have a substantial stake in the civil nuclear energy supply chain  which is currently dominated by overseas companies  at a time when we are looking for jobs and growth  the logic of that escapes me my third concern is the prospect of each eurozone country being bailed out as its economy falls into crisis without addressing the root causes of the continent s problems 
yes  but that is a matter for the eurozone  if the chancellor is right in his prediction that perhaps this can ensure that we come out of the €60 billion mechanism  the facility and the other moneys  then fine  but as we are making a big contribution more than we would have done had we paid the amount that a eurozone country would have paid to rescue ireland we must be in a position to influence this debate 
i am grateful for that clarification  we will look at that very carefully  what the chancellor is saying is that france and germany  through their imf contribution     interruption    the financial secretary says no  the point i am trying to get at perhaps the hon  gentleman can clear this up when he replies to the debate is that if the uk is putting in a bilateral loan that is equal to the amount that we would have paid as a eurozone member  and we are putting in money through the imf as well as £2 6 billion through the mechanism  how does that relate to the money that france and germany are contributing  as far as i am aware  they have no bilateral arrangements  so the money is going through the imf  or through the stability facility which accounts for only 4  of the resources  that is a point that we need to hear about 
i will not bother to take an intervention from the hon  lady next time  because that point does not even begin to be germane to this problem my third concern is how we are going to draw a line under this matter  we had the greek bail out  and now we have had the irish bail out  there is no sign of any real stability in the eurozone to stop such events happening again 
i am coming to exactly that point some conservative members think that the root cause is the single currency  i do not share that view  the euro had nothing to do with the property boom and bust  and a failed euro would be an economic and political disaster with repercussions well beyond our continent  ireland needs a healthy eurozone  or it will end up with years of deflation and unemployment  and we will be less likely to have our loan repaid as the loan that we are being asked to approve is equal to the amount of money that we would have contributed had we been a member of the eurozone  surely that gives us the right to influence the necessary debate on what action is needed to address the underlying causes of this recurring crisis  this bail out buys time  but there is no sign that europe s leaders know how to put it to good use  in may  we had the greek bail out  six months later  we have to deal with ireland  in neither case is there much sign that these countries have resolved the core dilemma  which is solvency collective austerity across europe offers countries with high debt burdens no way out  cutting demand in germany is the last thing that ireland needs at the moment  what we are seeing in europe bears out the imf s conclusion that fiscal austerity does not boost short term growth and that deficit cuts are more painful if they occur simultaneously across many countries  ireland needs a healthy eurozone with markets such as germany consuming irish goods  or it will end up with years of deflation and unemployment  having engaged in repeated rounds of austerity  with vat rises  welfare cuts and redundancies  ireland still finds growth elusive  it has been consistently poor for the past three years  indeed  the economy has shrunk in 11 of the 14 quarters since the beginning of 2007  and sluggish growth has made getting the deficit down much harder 
the hon  gentleman is right that the single currency gives ireland no mechanism to devalue its currency  and that that causes it a problem  however  there are two extremes to that argument  the first says that the eurozone is unfinished business  what started as a currency harmonisation needs to move to the next stage  i heard the president of the european central bank say on the radio last night that the next stage should be political integration  my party does not agree with that  nor i am sure does the hon  gentleman s  further integration is one extreme that we should not go to the second extreme says that if ireland simply withdrew from the euro or the eurozone  its problems would be solved  i do not believe that to be the case  the eurozone has to recognise the problem that its countries cannot devalue and must find a mechanism that ensures that this problem does not keep happening to country after country  the hon  member for harwich and north essex  mr jenkin  has a view  as do many of his colleagues  on the answer to this ongoing problem  i do not agree with him  but i believe that it is central to stop this happening to other countries  and to stop it being a regular event  the fragility of the recovery  especially in europe  emphasises the need for decisive action to resolve the underlying difficulties faced by eurozone countries the situation in ireland is a huge embarrassment for the chancellor  exposing as it does his poor judgment and rich hyperbole  at the time of the comprehensive spending review  he claimed that our country was on the brink of bankruptcy  he now proposes a loan of an amount that is well over half the cumulative debt interest savings that he claimed he would make over the spending review period  there is also the paradox of his support for ireland s banks  but his opposition to the previous government s successful measures to protect british banks finally  there is the chancellor s frequently expressed belief that britain should look to ireland for inspiration  which he expressed both before the banking crisis  when he urged us to emulate the  irish miracle   and since the crisis  with his desire to copy some of ireland s painful austerity measures  his gloriously misjudged 2006 article in  the times is now well known  ireland stands as a shining example of the art of the possible in long term economic policymaking  he is in good company  i shall quote from the prime minister in the  belfast telegraph on 26 october 2006 
no  i will not give way  the prime minister said  that is why a priority for any conservative government led by me will be to create a much better environment for business    we know it can be done  just look at the republic of ireland  two years later  at exactly the time when ireland s six largest banks were forced to borrow €20 billion from the european central bank  the prime minister said that ireland had a  future fund  of assets  providing security against future liabilities and unknown shocks coming down the line  perhaps those on the treasury bench will update us on how that future fund is doing in ireland  finally  in june 2008  at a cameron direct event in harlow  he said  when it comes to the engine room of the country  the economy  you know you can look across to southern ireland where they have created a dynamic economy  well we ve got to do that right here  our message to the chancellor as we prepare to support his bill is not to replicate ireland  but to repudiate the measures that put its economy in such a perilous position we understand that there is an o donnell circulating a plan b in whitehall against the chancellor s wishes  as the chancellor said in  the times  the irish have much to teach us  if only we are willing to learn  
responsibility for our manufacturing sector rests  of course  with the secretary of state for business  innovation and skills  who had some interesting things to say this morning about the  maoist  nature of this government     interruption   does the great leader or rather  the chancellor recognise himself in the business secretary s description of  cack handed  tories  strictly speaking  does the chancellor believe that the reason why we have waited so long for any sign of a strategy on jobs and growth is because he is out of step with his cabinet colleague 
we see this morning record borrowing for november  unemployment higher than expected and inflation well above where it should be  according to the office for budget responsibility  we are about to destroy £5 billion worth of economy activity through the increase in vat on 4 january  the institute for fiscal studies says that absolute poverty not relative poverty will rise for children and working age adults  with 900 000 more slipping below the breadline over the next three years  if the chancellor has not got a plan b yet  is he hoping to get one for christmas 
  urgent question   to ask the chancellor of the exchequer to make a statement on bankers  bonuses 
we are here to hold the government to account  i have with me the coalition agreement  and i believe that i can still sense the scent of the rose garden upon it  this is what it says in paragraph 1  we will bring forward detailed proposals for robust action to tackle unacceptable bonuses in the financial services sector  where are those detailed proposals  when will we see them  here is what the chancellor said in his spending review statement in october  fairness also means that  across the entire deficit reduction plan  those with the broadest shoulders will bear the greatest burden  those with the most should pay the most  and that includes our banks    today we set out very clearly  for all to take note of  our objective in taxing the banking industry going forward    our aim will be to extract the maximum sustainable tax revenues from financial services      official report  20 october 2010  vol  516  c  951 956  but he has given the banks a tax cut from £3 5 billion to £1 2 billion and they will benefit more than any other sector from the cut in corporation tax  cuts affecting children will contribute well over £5 billion and students will contribute £2 9 billion  does the chancellor think that children and students have the broadest shoulders  the man who said in opposition that no bonus should be higher than £2 000 will not even implement legislation forcing transparency about those receiving more than £1 million where is the deputy prime minister who  when not signing student pledges not to increase tuition fees or unveiling posters about vat bombshells  was saying  doesn t it make you angry that the banks have been allowed to ride roughshod over our economy  and are still handing out bonuses by the bucket load   so in just seven months  the coalition goes from the scent of the rose garden to the stench of broken promises  the chancellor who said   we re all in this together  bows to the rich and powerful while bearing down on everyone else  his sneering arrogance will not get him out of this one
